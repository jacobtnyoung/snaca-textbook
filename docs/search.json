    "text": "Preface\nIn 2011, law enforcement agencies in the United States faced mounting pressure to dismantle a sprawling drug trafficking operation that spanned multiple cities and involved various criminal subgroups. Traditional investigative methods, such as surveillance and wiretaps, had led to dozens of arrests, but the core leadership of the network remained insulated and elusive. With the organization’s adaptability and ability to replace arrested members, authorities struggled to make meaningful headway. This criminal enterprise, structured in decentralized cells, continued to thrive by exploiting its hidden communication channels and relying on intermediaries to shield the leaders from direct exposure.\nRecognizing the limitations of conventional approaches, investigators turned to social network analysis (SNA) to map out the complex web of relationships within the organization. Using SNA, they were able to identify not just the individuals who were visible through direct criminal activities but also those who occupied critical structural positions within the network. SNA revealed that a handful of individuals, who had previously appeared minor in traditional investigations, were in fact brokers who facilitated communication between isolated cells and the core leadership. These brokers operated at the intersection of different subgroups, acting as the glue that held the organization together (Morselli 2009). By strategically targeting these brokers, law enforcement disrupted key communication pathways and destabilized the network. The arrest of these intermediaries created confusion within the organization and led to further information leaks, ultimately exposing the previously hidden leadership structure. Authorities were able to make high-profile arrests, effectively crippling the operation (Malm and Bichler 2011).\nThis case exemplified the power of SNA to reveal otherwise invisible roles and relationships within criminal organizations, offering law enforcement a data-driven approach to strategically dismantling large-scale criminal enterprises. In today’s increasingly interconnected world, the study of social networks has become an essential tool for understanding crime. Why? Crime does not happen in isolation. Individuals involved in criminal activities are often embedded within broader social networks that can influence and even facilitate their behaviors. By understanding these networks, crime analysts can uncover hidden relationships between individuals, identify key players, and predict the movement of illicit information or resources. SNA encompasses a powerful set of tools (both theoretical and analytical) that help analysts move beyond simply tracking individual offenders to mapping the structures that support criminal behavior. This shift from a focus on individual actors to the entire system allows for a more nuanced understanding of how crime operates in communities and institutions, facilitates positive impacts on criminal apprehension, crime reduction, and long-term prevention efforts.\nBut SNA is not limited to analysts working within a law enforcement context. On the contrary, SNA has applicability to multiple problems faced across a variety of criminal justice agencies:\n\nPrisons: Inside prisons, social networks influence everything from inmate behavior to contraband smuggling and gang activity. SNA helps identify inmate leaders, those at risk of victimization, and potential sources of conflict. Understanding these dynamics can improve safety and reduce violence.\nProbation and Parole Officers: SNA can help officers understand the social networks of individuals on supervision, which may include influences that either support or undermine rehabilitation. By identifying pro-social networks, officers can encourage engagement with positive social influences, while also identifying risk factors related to recidivism, such as association with former criminal peers.\nProsecutors Defense Attorneys, and Judges: SNA can be used in building cases, particularly in conspiracy or organized crime prosecutions. It helps prosecutors demonstrate the relationships and communication patterns between co-conspirators, providing clearer evidence of a criminal enterprise or joint activity. For defense attorneys, SNA can be used to identify alternative explanations for their client’s involvement in a criminal network or to challenge the prosecution’s portrayal of their client’s role. If the client is not a central figure in the network, this could be used to argue for lesser charges or reduced sentences. Finally, judges can use SNA to help understand a defendant’s social network and can provide insights into the likelihood of recidivism or flight risk.\nPolicy Makers and Criminal Justice Reform Advocates: Policy makers can use SNA to understand the broader social dynamics that contribute to crime, such as how poverty, unemployment, and social exclusion fuel criminal networks. This can guide the development of crime prevention policies that target root causes and dismantle harmful networks, while promoting pro-social ones.\n\n\nThe Social Network Analysis for Crime Analysts (SNACA) textbook introduces the foundational concepts and techniques of social network analysis, providing a comprehensive framework for crime analysts to apply in their day-to-day work. Whether you are currently working in a criminal justice agency, or plan to do so in the future, the content of this textbook will prepare you to excel in such a role through the application of SNA. You will learn to map out criminal networks and analyze the roles of individuals within them. Through this lens, you will gain the ability to assess which individuals or nodes in a network are most critical to disrupting criminal activities. Moreover, these techniques will allow you to develop targeted strategies for crime and disorder reduction. By focusing on the most influential players within criminal networks, you can maximize the effectiveness of apprehension efforts, creating tangible outcomes that can dismantle harmful networks and reduce violence or other forms of crime in the community.\nBeyond tactical benefits, social network analysis empowers crime analysts to adopt a more preventive approach. By identifying patterns of association and influence within a network, you will be equipped to contribute to crime prevention strategies before criminal behavior escalates. For instance, by identifying vulnerable individuals on the periphery of a network, you can help law enforcement intervene early to redirect them away from criminal pathways. Additionally, the evaluation skills you gain will help you measure the effectiveness of these interventions, ensuring that existing strategies evolve to meet the unique challenges of crime and disorder. By the end, you will be well-prepared to make a meaningful contribution to criminal apprehension, crime and disorder reduction, prevention strategies, and the ongoing evaluation of those efforts.\nThis textbook is designed to introduce you to basic concepts used in SNA. The textbook is divided into chapters that cover a variety of these concepts. At the end of each chapter is a “Test your Knowledge” section that includes questions to determine whether you feel comfortable discussing the material. I would encourage you to think through these prompts after you read the chapter, but also come back to them occasionally to refresh your memory. The textbook is not exhaustive, but most of the major topics are discussed.\nFor those readers who are new to SNA, I would suggest starting at the beginning and working through in chronological order. For those readers who are already familiar with SNA, feel free to skip through the chapters.\n\n\n\n\nMalm, Aili, and Gisela Bichler. 2011. “Using Friends for Money: The Positional Importance of Money-Launderers in Organized Crime.” Trends in Organized Crime 14 (4): 272–93.\n\n\nMorselli, Carlo. 2009.

    "text": "Motivating Question and Empirical Example\nTo get a sense of what we do when we study networks, let’s start with a motivating question:\nWhat determines whether a police officer endorses the use of body-worn cameras and whether they activate their body-camera during an incident?\nMost accounts tend to focus on several factors:\n\nIndividual characteristics (e.g. age, experience)\nSituational characteristics (e.g. time of day, incident)\n\nIn other words, usually the explanation focuses on something about the person and/or something about the situation. Both of these explanations, though, tend to think about units (in this case police officers) as independent. For example, police officers endorse body-worn cameras because of their age or because of the characteristics of their beat. This may be true, but the underlying assumption is that officer endorsement is entirely independent from other officers in the department. This is the assumption of independence across units and underlies the vast majority of research in criminology and criminal justice.\nIn the study of networks, we are interested in the dependence between units as an explanatory tool. That is we are interested in the network!\nFor example, in a study by Young and Ready (2015) entitled, Diffusion of Ideas and Technology: The Role of Networks in Influencing the Endorsement and Use of On-Officer Video Cameras, the authors adopted a network perspective to examine two research questions:\n\nHow do police officers “frame” body-worn cameras?\nIs the meaning officers attribute to cameras created and transmitted in groups?\n\nTo answer these questions, they proposed the following model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this model, they argued that police officers’ views of body-worn cameras influence whether they use their cameras in incidents. But, where do these views come from? The authors proposed a contagion process whereby officers who shared incidents together exchanged views about the legitimacy of body-worn cameras. That is, much like a cold can be spread by contagious people, views about body-cameras are spread between officers. The medium by which these views spread is a social network.\nThus, the network matters! Rather than focusing on differences between individuals in terms of some attribute or situational experience, the study by Young and Ready (2015) was explicitly focused on the role that relationships between officers play in spreading attitudes, ideas, beliefs, etc. about body-worn cameras. Thinking about the problem in this way is an example of using the lens of a network perspective and is characteristic of what is called Network Science."

    "section": "Network Analysis",
    "text": "Network Analysis\nNetwork analysis is the set of tools used to study relational variables. That is, a variable that measures the relationship between entities (as opposed to the attributes of the entities themselves). In SNA, relational variables are used to describe the ties, interactions, or connections between actors (nodes) in a network. These variables do not focus on the individual characteristics of the actors but rather on how they relate to one another. For example, in a criminal network, a relational variable could be the frequency of communication between two individuals, the level of trust between them, or the type of criminal activity they collaborate on.\nHow is a relational variable different? The main contrast to relational variables is attribute variables (or actor variables), which describe the properties or characteristics of the entities themselves. These might include an individual’s age, gender, occupation, or criminal history. Attribute variables provide information about the individual actors (nodes), while relational variables focus on the connections between them. In SNA we commonly use attribute variables, but it is important to keep in mind that these are analytically separate from relational variables.\nNetwork analysis is the set of tools used to study relational variables. Just as there are tools for examining attribute variables (e.g. the correlation between age and criminal offending), SNA encompasses a set of methods for systematically understanding and identifying connections among actors (i.e. relational variables).\nConsider three different questions:\n\nAre kids who are risk-seeking more likely to drink alcohol?\nAre kids who have friends that drink alcohol more likely to drink alcohol?\nAre kids who drink alcohol more likely to be popular?\n\nNow, think about this:\n\nHow are these questions different?\nIs the causal logic the same?\nAre the policy implications the same? What are the variables?\n\nTake some time to think it through?\n\nDone? Good! Let’s examine these questions closer.\nThe questions differ substantially in causal logic:\n\nIn the first question, the independent variable is risk-seeking and the dependent variable is alcohol consumption. In the second question, the independent variable is alcohol consumption among friends. These two questions have different policy implications. The first would focus on reducing risk-seeking. The second would focus on disrupting the network. As a result, how we think about the problem has implications for which policy we design to address the problem.\nIn the third question, the independent variable is alcohol consumption and the dependent variable is a network variable, popularity. The policy implication here would be to reduce alcohol consumption if we were concerned about who (or who is not) popular.\n\nAgain, network science is about focusing on the relational aspect fo what is being studied. Think about a separate example from America’s “finest news source”, the Onion. As you read through it, ask yourself: “what does this story tell you about the relational structure of information transmission in the Shelton family?”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this story tell us about the relational structure of information transmission in the Shelton family? It is vulnerable! The network was flowing with juicy gossip until Aunt Laurie passed.\nTo understand, we can draw a picture illustrating the network described in the story:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes it vulnerable? All of the juicy gossip flows through aunt Laurie. She is a hub that everyone has to interact with to get information. What happened when aunt Laurie died? Communication is completely disrupted!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat could the Shelton family have done to make the network more resilient to disruption? Consider a separate network arrangement:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow what happens when aunt Laurie dies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication is not disrupted. This is because the network now has ties which make it less vulnerable to disruption. In network science jargon this is called redundancy and applies not only to social networks but any relational structure (e.g. electrical powerstation infrastructure).\nThe point here is this: these topics are inherently relational. They are not about comparing different, independent units. In other words, we are not comparing attributes of the individuals involved (e.g. who is more prone to gossip). The questions (and in the case of the Onion article, the joke) are about dependence between units."

    "text": "Network Science and Network Analysis\nIn doing network research (i.e. asking questions that involve networks and performing network analysis to answer the question), it is important to consider two crucial ideas:\n\nConceptualization\n\nThe process of defining what a concept is by creating a conceptual definition.\n\nOperationalization\n\nThe process of creating a concrete measure following a conceptual definition of a concept.\n\n\nNetwork science conceptualizes theoretical concepts that are inherently relational and operationalizes these constructs by drawing on the formal properties of graphs.\nLet’s take an example. Suppose we are interested in the concept of power in a gang. Some gang members may be more powerful than others and we may want to develop an intervention that focuses on the most powerful members. But, what does it mean to say that someone is powerful? There are many different ways to conceptualize power.\nOne way is to think about it is as being a central member of the gang. So, we could create a conceptual definition: powerful gang members are those who are central to the gang network. Ok, so how do we measure it? In other words, how do we operationalize power based on our conceptual definition? We could say that individuals who are central in the gang are those who are perceived as being central. So, we could ask gang members “who is the most central person in your gang?”. Then, we would have an operationalization of power in the gang.\nTo illustrate, consider a case study by Papachristos (2006) of a gang operating in an urban neighborhood. Law enforcement agencies had been investigating the gang for months, but traditional surveillance methods were failing to identify the key players who were directing most of the criminal activities. To tackle this, researchers decided to take a network perspective to the problem, guided by the conceptual definition that power within the gang is held by those perceived as central. They conducted interviews with current and former gang members, asking them directly, “Who is the most important person in your gang?” This simple question revealed individuals who were not initially flagged by police investigations but were considered highly influential by their peers. Upon further analysis, it became clear that these individuals controlled significant communication pathways and resources within the gang. By focusing on those perceived as central, law enforcement was able to disrupt key relationships and dismantle the gang’s leadership structure, demonstrating the effectiveness of operationalizing power through social perception.\nWhy does this matter? As you develop as a crime analyst, you will come to see the value of learning the process of identifying a concept, developing a conceptual definition, and creating an operational measure is an essential skill to hone.\nWhat makes SNA so powerful is that it allows us to use concepts and tools from mathematics to operationalize theoretical constructs that are relational, avoiding much of the murkiness of many concepts in the social sciences that are difficult to measure. To get a sense of how this works, we need to review some basic data elements."

    "text": "Basic Data Elements\nWhat do networks “look like”?\n\nNetwork (relational) data represents:\n\nConnections (also called ties, arcs, edges, lines, ties) among,\nEntities (also called nodes, vertices, actors, points, dots)\n\nTo be consistent, I will use the term node to refer to entities and edge to refer to connections.\nA node can be anything that can link to something else. Anything.\nAn edge can be anything that can record a connection between nodes. Anything.\nExamples:\n\nIn a friendship network the nodes are individuals and the edges are friendships.\nIn a co-offending network the nodes are individuals and the edges are offenses. That is, individuals are connected through offenses in which they both were present.\n\nOn a graph, nodes are represented by points and edges are represented by lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdges\n\nDirectionality\nEdges can be undirected, where an edge from A to B is the same as an edge from B to A:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor directed, where an edge from A to B is separate from an edge from B to A:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference is important. For example, suppose the edges of the networks below measure communication of information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are these structures different?\nIn the undirected network (on the left), all information can reach all three groups. To see this, start at any node and you can reach (by tracing) any other node following the lines.\nBut, in the directed network (on the right), information is “stuck” in the three clusters. Why?\nThis is because information comes from the center node and goes to each cluster. And it does not leave. Even though they all communicate in each cluster, information does not leave the clusters. To see this, start with any node and follow the arrows. Once you get into a single cluster, you cannot leave!\n\n\nValue\nEdges can take on different values. They can be:\n\nBinary (0 or 1; present or absent)\nValued integers (0, 1, 2,…)\nContinuous weights (0.24, 1.79,…)\nSigned (+ or -)\n\nFor example, in a friendship network the tie could measure whether we are friends or not (binary), how strong our friendship is (either using integers or continuous measures), or we whether we like (signed +) or dislike (signed -) each other.\n\n\nMeanings\nEdges can have different meanings and therefore can be of different types:\n\nSocial relationships (e.g. sister, friend, likes, knows)\nInteractions (has sex with, talks to, seeks advice from)\nFlows (diseases, attitudes, information)\n\nThese different types are important to keep in mind when we are thinking about what a tie represents.\n\n\n\nNodes\n\nModes/Node Partitions\nNetworks can differ with respect to the sets of nodes that define them. This refers to the modes of the network or the partitioning of the nodes:\n\nOne-mode/uni-partite (connections among one type of node). For example, A and B are friends. There is only one group of nodes, individuals.\nMulti-mode/multi-partite (connections among two or more types of nodes). For example A and B attend protests 1 and 2. There are two sets of nodes, individuals and protests. A and B are connected through their shared participation in the protests. The figure below illustrates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, the network for the study discussed above by Young and Ready (2015) is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this network, incidents (white circles) connect officers (squares and triangles). This is a two-mode/bipartite network because there are two sets of nodes: incidents and officers. The plot shows two types of officers, those who were in the treatment condition of the study (i.e. they were assigned a body-worn camera) and those who were in the control condition (i.e. they did not receive a camera). The focus of the study was how exposure to body-cameras during incidents influenced views, especially for those who were not assigned a camera.\nAs another example, Shjarback and Young (2018) examined the tendency for United States senators to sign different types of legislation. Specifically, the authors were interested in whether crime control legislation was more likely to be signed if individuals were from the same party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this network, there are two sets of nodes: bills (crime control and non-control) and senators (Democrats and Republicans). Crime control bills are the black squares and non-crime control bills are the white squares. Republication senators are shown as red circles and Democratic senators are shown as blue circles.\n\n\nPlexity\nNetworks can also differ with respect to the types of edges.\n\nSimplex (connections among nodes are of one type)\nMultiplex (connections among nodes are of multiple types)"

    "section": "Mechanisms in Network Theory",
    "text": "Mechanisms in Network Theory\n\nCapitalization\nModel: Flow\nGoal: Social Capital/Performance\nThis mechanism explains the benefits of social ties as providing resources. That is, individuals are able to capitalize on their ties, and this produces variation in resources. For example, consider the question: why do some individuals avoid recidivism upon reentry into the community after incarceration? Research on desistance highlights the critical role of social support systems in this process. Individuals who can draw on a diverse set of resources—such as employment opportunities, housing, and emotional support—from their social networks are better positioned to navigate the challenges of life post-release. A study by Visher and Travis (2003) found that those with strong, positive social ties, particularly to family and community organizations, were less likely to reoffend, as these connections facilitated access to essential resources and a sense of stability during the reintegration process. Put differently, resources flow through these relationships producing differences in individuals’ experiences with reentry.\n\n\nContagion\nModel: Flow\nGoal: Homogeneity\nThis mechanism explains homogeneity among nodes as the result of an “infection” process. That is, individuals become similar due to their exposure within their social network. For example, consider the question: why do some individuals become victims of gun violence? Research suggests that exposure to specific behavioral environments significantly increases the risk of gun violence victimization. In particular, individuals who are embedded in networks with others who have been victims of gun violence are more likely to become victims themselves. This phenomenon can be understood in epidemiological terms, where violence spreads through networks much like a contagious disease. Papachristos, Wildeman, and Roberto (2015) found that individuals’ proximity to others who have been shot dramatically increases their own likelihood of becoming a victim, illustrating the “social contagion” model of gun violence. That is, these individuals become similar (in this case victimization experience) due to the flow of violence through their network.\n\n\nCooperation\nModel: Coordination\nGoal: Social Capital/Performance\nTies facilitate coordination to solve collective problems. For example, why can some groups effectively enforce norms? According to Coleman (1990), network closure strengthens group identity and distributes the costs of sanctioning, allowing groups with these properties to maintain social control. In the context of crime, Papachristos (2009) argues that criminal groups, such as gangs, can enforce norms and regulate violence within their territories through network closure and strong internal ties. These groups rely on social capital built from dense, closed networks, which allows them to effectively coordinate behaviors, sanction rule-breakers, and maintain order within their communities.\n\n\nConvergence\nModel: Coordination\nGoal: Homogeneity\nNodes respond to or adapt to their environment, and homogeneity is often a consequence of this structural similarity. For example, who is most likely to engage in relational violence? Research suggests that adolescents in the middle of the friendship hierarchy (not at the top or bottom) are more likely to engage in relational violence as a way to maintain their social position and navigate the hierarchy. Faris and Felmlee (2011) found that adolescents in these middle positions tend to engage in aggressive behaviors like bullying or relational violence to protect or improve their social standing. Similarly, in gang networks, mid-ranking members—those not at the top of the leadership structure but not at the bottom—are often the ones most likely to engage in violent behaviors. According to Densley (2012), gang members in this mid-tier position often use violence as a strategy to solidify their standing within the group and prove their loyalty to more senior members, thereby navigating the social hierarchy within the gang.\n\n\nTheories of Networks\nNetwork Theory focuses on networks as an independent variable, where the network matters for some outcome. However, many studies focus on the network itself as a dependent variable, seeking to understand why a network structure exists as it does and/or how it may change as a consequence of some variable (e.g. an intervention). These studies usually adopt one of the metaphors (i.e. network flow or network coordination) to address the question, “why is the network this way?” For example, Bright and Delaney (2013) examine the evolution of a drug trafficking network, analyzing how its structure and function shifted as a result of external pressures such as law enforcement interventions. In this example, the network’s evolution is treated as the dependent variable, highlighting the impact of these forces on its adaptability and resilience. Similarly, Rostami and Mondani (2015) focus on the complexity of crime network data, investigating how network structure, centrality, and cohesiveness change over time. They also consider how interventions, such as law enforcement actions, influence these changes. Both studies illustrate how thinking of the network as a dependent variable offers valuable insights into the adaptability and transformation of networks under various pressures, emphasizing the role of external interventions in shaping network dynamics."

Specifically, we distinguished between “network theories” (which consider networks as a cause) and “theories of networks” (which view networks as an effect). Studies can be classified based on their explanatory model (how networks operate, such as flow or coordination) and their explanatory goal (what the study aims to explain, like social capital or homogeneity). Mechanisms like capitalization, contagion, cooperation, and convergence further explain how networks function in various contexts, such as criminal behavior and social control.\nIn the next chapter, we will examine how network data are collected.\n\n\n\n\nBright, David A, and JJ Delaney. 2013. “Evolution of a Drug Trafficking Network: Mapping Changes in Network Structure and Function Across Time.” Global Crime 14 (2-3): 238–60.\n\n\nCarley, Kathleen M, Ju-Sung Lee, and David Krackhardt. 2002. “Destabilizing Dynamic Covert Networks.” Proceedings of the 8th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, 1–10.\n\n\nColeman, James S. 1990.

    "text": "Case Study: Network Data Collection in a Gang Crime Investigation\nLet’s start with a case study. In a study of gang networks in Chicago, Papachristos, Hureau, and Braga (2013) sought to understand how violence spread within and between gangs. Their research focused on the impact of social networks on gun violence, identifying how specific individuals played a crucial role in coordinating violent activities. The study utilized network data to map the relationships between gang members and trace the diffusion of violence across the network.\nResearchers collected network data from several sources: arrest records (links between individuals arrested together), homicide and shooting data (links between individuals and gun violence incidents), and social ties and rivalries (information on known affiliations and rivalries between gang members). Each edge represented an interaction, allowing the researchers to construct a network of gang members linked through criminal activity or social ties. By incorporating both official records and street-level knowledge of gang relationships, the study created a comprehensive map of the social network driving gun violence in the city.\nThis case is an example that illustrates the diversity of data that can be used to build social networks. For crime analysts, comprehensive data collection is an important goal so as to ensure that all relevant ties and individuals are included (to the extent possible), as missing data could lead to incomplete or misleading conclusions about the network being analyzed."

    "text": "Types of Network Data Collection\nNetwork data can come from MANY sources. For example, data can be:\n\nObservational - Information about network ties are created by observing the links. An illustration of this is the Miller Project, which focused on youth gang affiliations in an urban environment. A key feature of the study was the collection of data by fieldworkers who conducted observations in public spaces where youth frequently interacted (parks, community centers, street corners). They documented social interactions, identifying key individuals who frequently connected otherwise disconnected groups. In a study by Young, Decker, and Sweeten (2018), the researchers reconstructed these observational data to create social networks.\nArchival - Data can also be collected through reconstructing historical data that exists in archives. For example, Papachristos and Smith (2012) conducted a detailed study of Al Capone’s criminal organization by reviewing records from law enforcement, newspapers, court and legal documents, and several other historical sources. The researchers were able to create a detailed sociogram of Capone’s criminal network, identifying the key actors and the strength of ties between them. The network revealed the presence of core members and peripheral associates, showing how resources and influence flowed through the organization.\nQuestionnaire - Network data can also come from questionnaire’s where someone asks somebody about their ties. For example, the Prison Inmate Network Studies (PINS) are a series of research studies focused on understanding social networks within prison environments (see Kreager et al. (2020)). Networks among incarcerated men and women were created by interviewing individuals about their social relationships in prison."

    "title": "Network Data Collection",
    "section": "Boundary Specification",
    "text": "Boundary Specification\nWhile there are various ways that network data can be collected, an important consideration is the issue of boundary specification. This concerns the theoretical and methodological challenge of determining the appropriate set of actors and connections to analyze in order to identify the relevant social network within a given context. When we collect data on a network we impose a particular boundary. For example, suppose we ask adolescents in a school who their friends are, but we only have a list of people in that school. The boundary would be those friends that are in the school. Does the boundary really exist? What about friendships that are outside of the school? Is the boundary imposed to conduct the research?\nThis is an important question to consider when collecting network data and when you are analyzing it. This can be a particular challenge for crime analysts given the types of data involved in our work. Defining clear boundaries influences the accuracy and effectiveness of the resulting analysis, which may have important implications for the policies that we identify from these analyses.\nConsider another example where a crime analyst is mapping the social network of a local gang involved in drug trafficking. In defining the network, the crime analyst has to decide whether to include only core gang members (e.g., those officially identified by law enforcement) or to also include associates who interact frequently with gang members. If the analyst focuses only on individuals with arrest records, they may overlook influential associates (e.g., suppliers, informants). However, including individuals without strong connections to the gang’s criminal activities might dilute the network’s focus. Another important consideration is the temporal aspect of boundary specification. Should the network only reflect current interactions, or include historical data? A network constructed over a multi-year period allows the analyst to observe changes over time. However, using a long time frame can introduce challenges in identifying which relationships remain relevant to current criminal activities. Finally, the sources used to define the network also impact boundary specification. In this example, we may base the network on co-arrest data. But, a crime analyst could also use informant reports, social media activity, or surveillance footage. Relying too heavily on one source (e.g., arrest records) could bias the analysis toward individuals already under law enforcement scrutiny."

    "section": "Instruments and Design",
    "text": "Instruments and Design\n\nInstruments are the tools used to elicit information from respondents. Some common examples are name-generators and rosters.\nDesign corresponds to the protocol for determining how information should be elicited, who should be sampled, and so on. Some examples are: ego-centric networks, partial networks, and complete/global networks\n\n\nEgo-Centric Networks\nWith ego-centric designs, data on a focal actor (ego) and ties to neighbors (alters) and the ties among the alters. The instrument is a “name generator” where individuals are prompted to elicit names that pertain to a connection of interest. For example, the General Social Survey (GSS) is a sociological survey that collects data on demographic characteristics, behaviors, and attitudes of residents in the United States that has been conducted since 1972. The GSS includes a social network measure that asks people the following question: “who are the people with whom you discuss important matters?” For each person named, the respondent is given the prompt “which of these individuals discuss important matters”?\n\n\nPartial Networks\nPartial networks extend data collection from the ego-centric design. Specifically, ego-centric data are collected, plus some amount of tracing to reach contacts of contacts. The instrument is a “tracing mechanism” whereby the network is “traced” by contacting those in ego’s network. For example, Klovdahl et al. (1994) used a link-tracing design to examine HIV risk networks, particularly focusing on drug users and their sexual partners. The project started with a purposively selected group of drug users. These individuals were asked to identify their sexual partners and drug-sharing contacts, who were then recruited into the study. The study aimed to understand how HIV spreads within networks of drug users, examining both direct and indirect relationships. The use of link-tracing was critical for reaching hidden or hard-to-reach populations, such as injection drug users and their social and sexual networks, which are often not accessible through traditional sampling methods.\n\n\nComplete/Global Network\nA final approach is to take a census of the network. In these situations, data on all actors within a particular (defined) boundary are known. The instrument can be a roster (e.g. “For each of the following persons, please indicate whom you trust to share personal information with?”) or perhaps a free response (e.g. “Who are the people in this prison that you trust with person information about you?”). We most commonly encounter this design when there is an identifiable sampling frame, such as a school or a prison, and a roster of members of the setting is known.\n\n\nThings to Consider\nAs you may have guessed, collecting network data involves a lot of questions and can sometimes seem a bit overwhelming. But, as you think about analyses you may do or are evaluating existing studies, think about the following areas:\n\nDomain - what type of network is this?\nSample - what is the population of interest and how was it sampled?\nTemporality - are the data cross-sectional or longitudinal? Is it a panel or continuous measurement?\nTie meaning - are ties discrete events or enduring states?\nInstrument - how was the information collected?"

    "section": "Graph Notation",
    "text": "Graph Notation\nLet’s start with some definitions. The definition of a graph is \\(G = (N,L)\\), where \\(N = {n_1, n_2..., n_g}\\) defines the set of nodes and \\(L = {l_1, l_2..., l_L}\\) defines the set of edges. This definition simply states that there are \\(N\\) nodes and \\(L\\) edges in a graph.\nTwo nodes, \\(n_i\\) and \\(n_j\\) are called adjacent if the line \\(l_k = (n_i, n_j)\\). What this means is that in the graph, there exists a line between nodes i and j.\n\nNode Sets\nAs discussed in the “Basic Data Elements” section of the Introduction to Social Network Analysis for Crime Analysts chapter, the directionality of a graph indicates whether the edges are undirected or directed. In an undirected graph, the order of the nodes does not matter. In other words, \\(l_k = (n_i, n_j) = (n_j, n_i)\\). This is to say that if there exists a line between nodes i and j, then a line exists between j and i. (This may seem obvious, but will make more sense why we talk about it this way when we get to directed graphs.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjacency\nTwo nodes, \\(n_i\\) and \\(n_j\\) are adjacent if the link \\(l_k = (n_i,n_j)\\). This is to say that in the graph, there exists an edge between nodes i and j. For a set of relations, \\(X\\), we can define a matrix which represents these relations. We commonly use an adjacency matrix, where each node is listed on the row and the column. The \\(i_{th}\\) row and the \\(j_{th}\\) column of \\(X_{ij}\\) records the value of a tie from i to j. In this approach, \\(X\\), can be thought of as a variable. The presence or absence of values in the cells represent variation. In the Introduction to Social Network Analysis for Crime Analysts chapter we covered “structural variables”. The data object \\(X\\) is how we go about examining structural variables.\nHere are some important definitions that we will come across as we talk about network data structures:\n\nScalar-a single number\nColumn vector-a column of numbers\nRow vector-a row of numbers\nMatrix-a rectangular array of numbers\nOrder-number of rows and columns defining the matrix\nSquare matrix-number of rows and columns of matrix are equal\n\n\nUndirected, Binary Graphs\nA plot of a network is sometimes referred to as a sociogram. Here is a sociogram for an undirected network where the ties are represented as zeros and ones:\nWe can represent the graph as a matrix using an adjacency matrix (sometimes called a sociomatrix):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most instances, we do not allow self-nominations, so the diagonal of the matrix is usually undefined or set to zero. In networks that allow self-nominations, you can have values on the diagonal. These are referred to as loops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first row, i is connected to the second row only: \\(X_{12}=1; X_{15}=0\\) (where \\(X_{ij}\\) refers to the \\(i^{th}\\) row and the \\(j^{th}\\) column of the matrix).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this graph is undirected, it is symmetric about the diagonal. This means that \\(X_{ij} = X_{ji}\\) or that the \\(i^{th}\\) column is the transposition of the \\(j^{th}\\) row, as shown in the figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, what does the rest of the matrix look like? Fill in the values in the matrix based on the graph.\nDone? It should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highlighted section here is called the upper triangle of the matrix. The sum of the upper triangle should equal the number of edges in the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other highlighted section here is called the lower triangle of the matrix. The sum of the lower triangle should also equal the number of edges in the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could sum all the elements and divide by 2.\n\n\nDirected, Binary Graphs\nIn a directed graph, the order of the nodes does matter. Specifically, \\(l_k1 = (n_i, n_j) \\neq (n_j, n_i) = l_k2\\). As we did above, we can use an adjacency matrix to represent this information in matrix form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is different in our matrix when the graph is directed?\nIn the first row, i sends to the second row: \\(X_{12}=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, in the second row, j does not send \\(X_{21}=0\\). The Jen/Tom dyad is asymmetric. Directed graphs permit this asymmetry because \\(l_k1 = (n_i, n_j) \\neq (n_j, n_i) = l_k2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the Leaf/Bob dyad? Is it asymmetric or is it symmetric?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, what does the rest of the matrix look like? Fill in the values in the matrix based on the graph.\nDone? It should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that because we are allowing directionality to matter, the total number of edges in the network is just the sum of the entire matrix (which is different from undirected graphs where we divide that sum by 2)."

    "text": "Simple Network Summary\nSo you have you network data, now what? The next step is to summarize its most critical features, which can guide your analysis. First, consider the size: How big is the network? This is the number of nodes involved, giving a sense of its scale. Next, think about how tightly connected the network is—this is the density, or the proportion of actual connections relative to all possible ones. Another key question is separation: How fragmented or divided is the network? Understanding its components or subgraphs can highlight isolated clusters. Finally, consider the network’s compactness, or its diameter, how far do nodes have to travel through connections to reach others? These four basic measures lay the groundwork for describing and understanding the structure of any network you encounter in your analysis.\n\nSize\nPut simply: how big is it? The size of the network is just the number of nodes in the network. We represent this with \\(g\\).\nIn the graphs below, what is \\(g\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity\nOf the ties that could exist, what fraction are observed? This is the density of a graph: the number of edges compared to how many ties there could be.\n\nUndirected Graph\nThe density of an undirected graph is given by: \\[\\frac{2L}{g(g-1)}\\] where \\(L\\) is the number of edges and \\(g\\) is the number of nodes. So, if a network has 5 nodes (i.e. \\(g\\) is 5) then we could observe \\(g(g-1) = 5*(5-1) = 5*4 = 20\\) edges. Take a look at the undirected graph below, what is the density?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we identify the quantities: \\(L\\) is 5 and \\(g\\) is 5. Now, let’s just plug through the math: \\[\\frac{2L}{g(g-1)} = \\frac{2*5}{5*(5-1)} = \\frac{10}{20} = 0.5\\] So, 0.5, or half, of the ties that could occur in this network did occur.\n\n\nDirected Graph\nThe density of a directed graph is given by: \\[\\frac{L}{g(g-1)}\\] where \\(L\\) is the number of edges and \\(g\\) is the number of nodes. So, if a network has 5 nodes (i.e. \\(g\\) is 5) then we could observe \\(g(g-1) = 5*(5-1) = 5*4 = 20\\) edges. Take a look at the directed graph below, what is the density?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we identify the quantities: \\(L\\) is 8 and \\(g\\) is 5. Why is \\(L\\) 8? Since the graph is directed, a dyad (or two nodes) can have two ties. For example, there is a tie from Jim to Leaf and a tie from Leaf to Jim. If we count up all the arrowheads, we get to 8. Now, let’s just plug through the math: \\[\\frac{L}{g(g-1)} = \\frac{8}{5*(5-1)} = \\frac{8}{20} = 0.4\\] So, 0.4 of the ties that could occur in this network did occur.\n\n\n\nComponents\nSo far, we have seen graphs where the nodes are connected either directly or indirectly. For example, in the directed graph above, Jen is not directly connected to every node, but you can trace a path from Jen to all other nodes in the graph. But what about graphs where the nodes are not able to reach other nodes? In other words, what about graphs where there are separated groups of nodes? These disconnected subgraphs are referred to as components.\nTake a look at the plot below. How many components are there?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo figure it out, just count up the number of separate subgraphs (or different colors of nodes). In this plot, there are 15 components. Note that the components are not all the same. Some are larger than others. In a graph that has different size components, the first component is the subgraph (i.e. component) with the most nodes. In this plot, the nodes in the first component are labeled “1”. The second component of a graph is the component that has the second-most nodes and the third component has the third most nodes (and so on). In the plot, what are the second and third components?\nThe components of a graph are a useful tool for helping us think conceptually about what our network means. For example, Papachristos and Wildeman (2014) conducted a study of homicide, examining how individuals may be disproportionately exposed to violence. Violence often spreads between components through a small number of brokers who connect otherwise isolated factions. Identifying and targeting these brokers or the most violent components can significantly reduce retaliatory violence. Isolated components also offer opportunities for more focused community interventions. By understanding these network structures, law enforcement can prevent the spread of violence and effectively target interventions.\n\n\nDiameter\nA final question we can ask is how compact is the network? In other words, can nodes reach other nodes directly and indirectly fairly easily? Or, are nodes really far from each other?\nTo understand diameter, let’s set up a definition: A step is movement along an edge. Let’s think about how this works. For example, take two nodes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) who are directly connected. How many steps is \\(A\\) from \\(B\\)? Since \\(A\\) is directly tied to \\(B\\), the number of steps is 1. Now, take another example where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not directly connected. Rather, suppose \\(A\\) is connected to \\(D\\), whom is connected to \\(C\\), whom is connected to \\(B\\), like this: \\(A-D-C-B\\). How many steps is \\(A\\) from \\(B\\)? Well, how many edges are there between them? There are 3 edges.\nWe can extend this to an entire graph by calculating the steps for every pair of nodes (i.e. dyads) in the graph. When we do this, we can define two other terms:\n\nA shortest path is the fewest number of steps node \\(A\\) has to take to reach node \\(B\\);\nThe diameter is the longest of all the shortest paths in the network.\n\n\nUndirected Graph\nLet’s see how this works in an undirected graph. In the plot below, what is the shortest path from Leaf to Jen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer this question, we need to first figure out what the paths are, then figure out which is the shortest (i.e. has the fewest edges to traverse). In this plot there are two:\n\n\\(Leaf-Jim-Bob-Tom-Jen\\)\n\\(Leaf-Bob-Tom-Jen\\)\n\nThe second path, \\(Leaf-Bob-Tom-Jen\\), is the shortest path.\nNow, what is the diameter of the network? To figure this out, we would identify the shortest paths for all pairs of nodes, then see which is the largest. So, taking a look at this plot, what is the diameter? It is 3. The longest shortest paths (I know, it sounds confusing) are \\(Leaf-Bob-Tom-Jen\\) and \\(Jim-Bob-Tom-Jen\\). Both are of length 3.\n\n\nDirected Graph\nPaths with directed graphs can be a bit tricky to comprehend due to the directionality of the ties. For example, for how many steps is \\(A\\) from \\(B\\) in this graph, \\(B \\rightarrow D \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow A\\)? If we focus on the direction of the ties, then \\(A\\) cannot reach \\(B\\). But, if we ignore the direction of the ties, then \\(A\\) is 3 steps from \\(B\\). Often, we ignore the directionality of a network to calculate the diameter. But, in some cases it might not make sense to do so. Just keep this in mind as you are working with different networks as a crime analyst."

If you are an organization who hosts such sites, what can you do to reduce hate speech? One approach is to “deplatform” particular individuals. This approach is a type of strategic network disruption whereby select individuals are removed from the network with the goal of reducing hate speech among those who are still using the platform. The logic is that these individuals are critical links that connect others and their absence will reduce hateful content. Does it work?\nThis is the question that Thomas and Wahedi (2023) sought to address when they identified hate organizations on Facebook and evaluated whether removing central individuals reduced hate speech in those organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes! As shown in the figure above (by the way, this is Figure 1 from the article), the authors found that hate speech declined in the organizations after the intervention. The overall finding is that deplatforming can be effective at reducing online hate speech. For our purposes here, it illustrates the role that centrality plays in thinking about networks. The authors examined a situation where central actors were removed as an intervention.\nNow, let’s start from the beginning and really be precise with our thinking about centrality."

    "text": "Concepts and Operationalization\nWhen we say a node is “central”, what do we mean conceptually? If your thinking what I’m thinking, it probably has something to to with a node being important. When we talk about centrality, then we are talking about the importance of a node.\nSpeaking generally, network position should be interesting and important:\n\nAs a description of the position of a node\nAnd as a description of an entire network\n\nWe will review centrality for individual nodes as well as how centrality can be used to describe an entire network (hint: we call it centralization).\n\nConceptualization\n\n“Everyone agrees, it seems, that centrality is an important structural attribute of networks. All concede that it is related to a high degree to other important group properties and processes. But there consensus ends.” (Freeman (1978/1979): 217)\n\nThe type of measure we use depends on the substantive question of interest. Various measures of centrality are correlated, but they operationalize different concepts. Put differently, there is not a single measure of centrality because what we mean by “centrality” can differ.\nHere are three typical ways of thinking about centrality:\n\nDegree\nBetweenness\nCloseness\n\nIn this and subsequent chapters, we will discuss each of these concepts, how they are conceptualized and how they are operationalized in social network analysis.\nIt is also important to distinguish between whether we are talking about the centrality of a node or the centrality of a graph:\n\nThe centrality of a node (whether it is measured as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, or closeness centrality) refers to point centrality. In other words, the centrality of a particular node in a graph. When we talk about point centrality, we are usually comparing different nodes. For example, is Jim more central than Joan?\nIn addition, we can also describe the centrality of an entire graph, referred to as graph centrality. The centrality measure on an entire graph tells us how centrality measures differ between nodes in a graph. As we will see, we can describe how hierarchical or decentralized a graph is based on the centralization of the graph.\n\nAs with prior chapters, we will start with undirected graphs and then move to directed graphs."

    "section": "Undirected Graphs",
    "text": "Undirected Graphs\n\nDegree Centrality\nIn an undirected binary graph, degree centrality measures the extent to which a node connects to all other nodes in a network. In other words, the number of edges incident with a node. This is symbolized as: \\(d(n_i)\\) and this reads “degree for the \\(i_{th}\\) node”. For an undirected binary graph, the degree, \\(d(n_i)\\), is simply the row or column sum. We can express this formally as:\n\n\\(C_D(n_i) = \\sum_j x_{ij} = \\sum_j x_{ji}\\)\nWhich reads: the degree centrality of node i is the sum over the other nodes in the graph (i.e. \\(\\sum_j x_{ij} = \\sum_j x_{ji}\\)). If i is connected to j, recall that there would be a 1 in the \\(X_{ij}\\) cell, where \\(X\\) is the sociomatrix. If i is not connected to j, then there would be a 0 in the \\(X_{ij}\\) cell. The equation is just telling us to sum all of the entries.\n\nLet’s take a look at this with some data. Recall our example network with Jen, Tom, Bob, Leaf, and Jim. Let’s find the degree centrality score for each node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall from above that in an undirected network the degree centrality score is either the sum of the row or the sum of the column. Let’s calculate the score for Jen. If we look across the row (that is, horizontally) we see that the cell values are: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0. If we add these we get 1. That is, Jen’s degree centrality score is 1. If we look across the column, we get the same information: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0. Put another way: \\(C_D(Jen) = \\sum_j x_{ij} = x_{Jen, Tom} + x_{Jen, Bob} + x_{Jen, Leaf} + x_{Jen, Jim} = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1\\).\nJen’s degree centrality score is 1, meaning that she has 1 tie. Notice in the calculation that we didn’t include \\(x_{ii}\\) which is \\(x_{Jen, Jen}\\) because this is zero. Be careful when you do the calculations that you don’t confuse these. Since self-nominations are usually set to zero, this is not a problem when we use the row or column totals. Just something to keep in mind.\nWhat about the rest of the nodes? Let’s do the calculations:\n\nTom = \\(C_D(Tom) = \\sum_j x_{ij} = x_{Tom, Jen} + x_{Tom, Bob} + x_{Tom, Leaf} + x_{Tom, Jim} = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2\\)\nBob = \\(C_D(Bob) = \\sum_j x_{ij} = x_{Bob, Jen} + x_{Bob, Tom} + x_{Bob, Leaf} + x_{Bob, Jim} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\\)\nLeaf = \\(C_D(Leaf) = \\sum_j x_{ij} = x_{Leaf, Jen} + x_{Leaf, Tom} + x_{Leaf, Bob} + x_{Leaf, Jim} = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2\\)\nJim = \\(C_D(Jim) = \\sum_j x_{ij} = x_{Jim, Jen} + x_{Jim, Tom} + x_{Jim, Bob} + x_{Jim, Jim} = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2\\)\n\n\nStandardization\nActor degree centrality not only reflects each node’s connectivity to other nodes but also depends on the size of the network, g. Larger networks will have a higher maximum possible degree centrality value. This is called a raw score. How can we use nodes from different sized networks?\nStandardize! If we want to compare nodes in different sized networks, then we just take into account the number of nodes and the maximum possible nodes to which i could be connected. In an undirected graph, this is g-1.\nThus, we can calculate a standardized degree centrality for an undirected graph as:\n\\[C'_D(n_i) =  \\dfrac{C_D(n_i)}{g-1} = \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{j} x_{ij}}{g-1}\\]\nWhat this gives us the proportion of the network members with ties to actor i. A convenient feature of standardizing in this way is that it means the index varies between 0 (no connections; isolate) to 1 (ties to every actor). Again, let’s take a look at our example network:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this graph, the denominator, g-1 is \\(5 - 1 = 4\\). Plugging that in we get: \\(C'_D(n_i) = \\dfrac{C_D(n_i)}{4}\\).\nAnd recall our raw scores:\n\nJen = 1\nTom = 2\nBob = 3\nLeaf = 2\nJim = 2\n\nSo, we just adjust the raw scores by standardizing by the denominator:\n\nJen = \\(C'_D(Jen) = \\dfrac{C_D(1)}{4} = 0.25\\)\nTom = \\(C'_D(Tom) = \\dfrac{C_D(2)}{4} = 0.50\\)\nBob = \\(C'_D(Bob) = \\dfrac{C_D(3)}{4} = 0.75\\)\nLeaf = \\(C'_D(Leaf) = \\dfrac{C_D(2)}{4} = 0.50\\)\nJim = \\(C'_D(Jim) = \\dfrac{C_D(2)}{4} = 0.50\\)\n\nHow is this to be interpreted? The standardized degree centrality score gives us the proportion of the network members with ties to actor i. So, a score of 0.25 for Jen means that Jen has ties to 25% of the nodes that she could potentially have ties to in the network. In other words, of the four people she could have ties with, she only has ties with one node.\n\n\n\nMean Degree\nWe can examine the summary statistics for degree centrality by inspecting the mean. The average degree is an important property of a network. Why? What does a network with a high average degree look like? A low average degree?\nThe mean degree for an undirected network is:\n\\[\\bar C_D =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_D(n_i)}{g} = \\dfrac{2L}{g}\\]\nThis may look a bit overwhelming, but we can break it into pieces:\n\n\\(\\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_D(n_i)}{g}\\) just says to sum up the degrees for each node and then divide by the number of nodes, g.\n\\(\\dfrac{2L}{g}\\) shows that the equation above reduces to a simple calculation, the number of edges in the graph, L, multiplied by 2 and then divided by the number of nodes, g.\n\nWhat is the mean degree for our example network? Well, we have \\(L=5\\) and \\(g = 5\\), so plugging the numbers we get:\n\\[\\bar C_D =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_D(n_i)}{g} = \\dfrac{2L}{g} = \\dfrac{2*5}{5} = \\dfrac{10}{5} = 2\\] The average degree for this graph is 2. In other words, on average, a node has two edges.\n\n\nDegree Centralization\nIn addition to summarizing the graph with the mean degree, we can also calculate the centralization of the graph. Centralization measures the extent to which the nodes in a social network differ from one another in their individual centrality scores. Put differently, how much variation is there in the distribution of centrality scores?\nWe can calculate this as:\n\\[C_A =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g [C_A(n^*) - C_A(n_i)]}{max \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g [C_A(n^*) - C_A(n_i)]}\\]\nAgain, this may look imposing, but we can decompose it to see what it is doing:\n\n\\(C_A(n^*)\\) is the largest degree centrality scored observed in the graph\n\\(C_A(n_i)\\) is the degree centrality score for node i\n\\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g [C_A(n^*) - C_A(n_i)]\\) simply takes the sum of deviations for each node from the largest value\nFinally, we take that sum and divide it by \\(max \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g [C_A(n^*) - C_A(n_i)]\\), which is the theoretical maximum sum possible of differences\n\nThis should look familiar, recall from your introductory statistics course that the standard deviation of a variable, y is:\n\\[SD_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum{(y_i - \\mu)}^2}{N}}\\]\nThat is, the sum of squared deviations of \\(y_i\\) from the population mean, \\(mu\\), divided by N, the size of the population. We are doing something similar with the centralization score. It is the sum of observed differences divided by the theoretical maximum sum possible of differences.\nFor degree centrality, the maximum possible sum of differences is calculated as \\((g-1)(g-2)\\). Which makes the equation:\n\\[C_D =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g [C_D(n^*) - C_D(n_i)]}{[(g-1)(g-2)]}\\]\nIf I lost you in some of the math, don’t worry. Let’s calculate the degree centralization score for our example graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd recall our raw scores:\n\nJen = 1\nTom = 2\nBob = 3\nLeaf = 2\nJim = 2\n\nBob has the largest degree at 3. This means that \\(C_D(n^*) = 3\\). Finally, recall that \\(g = 5\\) since we have 5 nodes.\nNow, all we have to do is plug in the values:\n\\[C_D =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g [C_D(n^*) - C_D(n_i)]}{[(g-1)(g-2)]} = \\dfrac{(3-1)+(3-2)+(3-3)+(3-2)+(3-2)}{(5-1)(5-2)} = \\dfrac{2+1+0+1+1}{4*3}= \\dfrac{5}{12}= 0.417\\]\nSo, the degree centralization score for our example graph is 0.417. What does this mean?\nWhen degree centrality is evenly dispersed, meaning that all nodes have the same degree, then the numerator in the equation will be zero and the quotient will be close to 0. When there is considerable inequality in the degree centrality scores between nodes, the quotient will be closer to 1. Thus, closer to 1 indicates that the graph is hierarchically structured and closer to 0 means that the graph is more decentralized.\nWe can see this by examining two additional undirected networks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe degree centralization score for the figure on the left is 1.0. We can see this by doing the calculations:\n\\[C_D =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g [C_D(n^*) - C_D(n_i)]}{[(g-1)(g-2)]} = \\dfrac{(4-4)+(4-1)+(4-1)+(4-1)+(4-1)}{(5-1)(5-2)} = \\dfrac{0+3+3+3+3}{4*3}= \\dfrac{12}{12}= 1.0\\]\nThe degree centralization score for the figure on the right is 0. We can see this by doing the calculations:\n\\[C_D =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g [C_D(n^*) - C_D(n_i)]}{[(g-1)(g-2)]} = \\dfrac{(2-2)+(2-2)+(2-2)+(2-2)+(2-2)}{(5-1)(5-2)} = \\dfrac{0+0+0+0+0}{4*3}= \\dfrac{0}{12}= 0.0\\]"

    "text": "Directed Graphs\n\nDegree Centrality\nIn a directed binary graph, degree centrality can be broken down into indegree and outdegree centrality:\n\nIndegree, \\(C_I(n_i)\\), measures the number of ties that i receives. For the sociomatrix \\(X_{ij}\\), the indegree for i is the column sum:\n\n\\[C_I(n_i) = \\sum_j x_{ji}\\]\n\nOutdegree, \\(C_O(n_i)\\), measures the number of ties that i sends. For the sociomatrix \\(X_{ij}\\), the outdegree for i is the row sum:\n\n\\[C_O(n_i) = \\sum_j x_{ij}\\]\nWhat are the indegree and outdegree centrality scores in the following graph?:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndegree\nLet’s start with the indegree. As stated above, indegree, \\(CI(n_i)\\), measures the number of ties that i receives. For the sociomatrix \\(X_{ij}\\), the indegree for i is the column sum: \\(C_I(n_i) = \\sum_j x_{ji}\\). So, to get the indegree for each node, we just sum over the columns. Recall that columns are vertical.\nLet’s calculate the indegree for Jen: \\(C_I(Jen) = \\sum_j x_{j,Jen} = x_{Tom,Jen} + x_{Bob,Jen} + x_{Leaf,Jen} + x_{Jim,Jen} = 0+0+0+0 = 0\\)\nJen’s indegree is 0 because she doesn’t receive any ties from other nodes. Let’s calculate the indegree for the rest of the nodes:\n\n\\(C_I(Tom) = \\sum_j x_{j,Tom} = x_{Jen,Tom} + x_{Bob,Tom} + x_{Leaf,Tom} + x_{Jim,Tom} = 1+0+0+0 = 1\\)\n\\(C_I(Bob) = \\sum_j x_{j,Bob} = x_{Jen,Bob} + x_{Tom,Bob} + x_{Leaf,Bob} + x_{Jim,Bob} = 0+1+1+1 = 3\\)\n\\(C_I(Leaf) = \\sum_j x_{j,Leaf} = x_{Jen,Leaf} + x_{Tom,Leaf} + x_{Bob,Leaf} + x_{Jim,Leaf} = 0+0+1+1 = 2\\)\n\\(C_I(Jim) = \\sum_j x_{j,Jim} = x_{Jen,Jim} + x_{Tom,Jim} + x_{Bob,Jim} + x_{Leaf,Jim} = 0+0+1+1 = 2\\)\n\n\n\nOutdegree\nLet’s now look at the outdegree. With indegree, we are looking at the ties coming into a node. But, with outdegree we are doing the opposite, looking at the ties that are coming from the node. As stated above, Outdegree, \\(CO(n_i)\\), measures the number of ties that i sends. For the sociomatrix \\(X_{ij}\\), the outdegree for i is the row sum \\(C_O(n_i) = \\sum_j x_{ij}\\). So, to get the outdegree for each node, we just sum over the rows. Recall that rows are horizontal.\nLet’s calculate the outdegree for Jen: \\(C_O(Jen) = \\sum_j x_{Jen,j} = x_{Jen,Tom} + x_{Jen,Bob} + x_{Jen,Leaf} + x_{Jen,Jim} = 1+0+0+0 = 1\\)\nLet’s calculate the outdegree for the rest of the nodes:\n\n\\(C_O(Tom) = \\sum_j x_{Tom,j} = x_{Tom,Jen} + x_{Tom,Bob} + x_{Tom,Leaf} + x_{Tom,Jim} = 0+1+0+0 = 1\\)\n\\(C_O(Bob) = \\sum_j x_{Bob,j} = x_{Bob,Jen} + x_{Bob,Tom} + x_{Bob,Leaf} + x_{Bob,Jim} = 0+0+1+1 = 2\\)\n\\(C_O(Leaf) = \\sum_j x_{Leaf,j} = x_{Leaf,Jen} + x_{Leaf,Tom} + x_{Leaf,Bob} + x_{Leaf,Jim} = 0+0+1+1 = 2\\)\n\\(C_O(Jim) = \\sum_j x_{Jim,j} = x_{Jim,Jen} + x_{Jim,Tom} + x_{Jim,Bob} + x_{Jim,leaf} = 0+0+1+1 = 2\\)\n\nNow, let’s compare the indegree and outdegree:\n\n\n\nNode\nIndegree\nOutdegree\n\n\n\n\nJen\n0\n1\n\n\nTom\n1\n1\n\n\nBob\n3\n2\n\n\nLeaf\n2\n2\n\n\nJim\n2\n2\n\n\n—–\n——–\n———\n\n\nTotal\n8\n8\n\n\n\nNote that both the indegree and outdegree total to the same amount. This makes sense because there are \\(L=8\\) edges in the graph.\n\n\nStandardization\nRecall that indegree/outdegree centrality not only reflects each node’s connectivity to other nodes but also depends on the size of the graph, g. Larger networks will have a higher maximum possible degree centrality value. We can standardize, or normalize, the same way by dividing by g-1.\nFor our example graph, \\(g-1 = 4\\) and that our raw scores:\n\nIndegree\n\nJen = 0\nTom = 1\nBob = 3\nLeaf = 2\nJim = 2\n\nOutdegree\n\nJen = 1\nTom = 1\nBob = 2\nLeaf = 2\nJim = 2\n\n\nWe just adjust the raw indegree scores by standardizing by the denominator:\n\nJen = \\(C'_I(Jen) = \\dfrac{0}{4} = 0.00\\)\nTom = \\(C'_I(Tom) = \\dfrac{1}{4} = 0.25\\)\nBob = \\(C'_I(Bob) = \\dfrac{3}{4} = 0.75\\)\nLeaf = \\(C'_I(Leaf) = \\dfrac{2}{4} = 0.50\\)\nJim = \\(C'_I(Jim) = \\dfrac{2}{4} = 0.50\\)\n\nHow is this to be interpreted? The standardized indegree centrality score gives us is the proportion of the network members for whom node i has received a tie. A score of 0.25 for Tom means that Tom received ties from 25% of the nodes that he could potentially have received ties from in the network.\nFor the raw outdegreee scores we do the same:\n\nJen = \\(C'_O(Jen) = \\dfrac{1}{4} = 0.25\\)\nTom = \\(C'_O(Tom) = \\dfrac{1}{4} = 0.25\\)\nBob = \\(C'_O(Bob) = \\dfrac{2}{4} = 0.50\\)\nLeaf = \\(C'_O(Leaf) = \\dfrac{2}{4} = 0.50\\)\nJim = \\(C'_O(Jim) = \\dfrac{2}{4} = 0.50\\)\n\nHow is this to be interpreted? The standardized outdegree centrality score gives us is the proportion of the network members for whom node i has sent a tie. A score of 0.25 for Tom means that Tom sends ties to 25% of the nodes that he could potentially have sent ties to in the network.\n\n\n\nMean Degree\nAs before, we can examine the summary statistics for indegree/outdegree centrality by inspecting the mean:\n\\[\\bar d =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_I(n_i)}{g} = \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_O(n_i)}{g} = \\dfrac{L}{g}\\] We just take the number of edges in the graph, \\(L\\), and divide it by the number of nodes in the graph, \\(g\\).\nAs it turns out, the mean indegree and mean outdegree are equal. This is because we are counting up, for the numerator, the number of edges.\nWhat is the mean indegree/outdegree for this graph?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\bar d =  \\dfrac{C_I(n_i)}{g} = \\dfrac{C_O(n_i)}{g} = \\dfrac{L}{g} = \\dfrac{8}{5} = 1.6\\]\nThis means that, on average, a node sends 1.6 ties and receives 1.6 ties.\n\n\nDegree Centralization\nAs with the undirected graph, we can also calculate how centralized the edges are in the graph. Recall that degree centralization measures the extent to which the nodes in a graph differ from one another in their individual degree centrality scores. For a directed graph, the difference is that the denominator is \\((g-1)^2\\) or \\((g-1)(g-1)\\). The difference is due to the directional nature of the graph. So, this gives us the following equation for either the indegree centralization score or the outdegree centralization score:\n\\[C_D =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g [C_D(n^*) - C_D(n_i)]}{[(g-1)^2]}\\]\n\nIndegree Centralization\nLet’s calculate the indegree centralization score for our example graph. Recall our raw indegree scores:\n\nJen = 0\nTom = 1\nBob = 3\nLeaf = 2\nJim = 2\n\nBob has the largest degree at 3. This means that \\(C_D(n^*) = 3\\). Finally, recall that \\(g = 5\\) since we have 5 nodes.\nNow, all we have to do is plug in the values:\n\\[C_I =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g [C_I(n^*) - C_I(n_i)]}{[(g-1)(g-1)]} = \\dfrac{(3-0)+(3-1)+(3-3)+(3-2)+(3-2)}{(5-1)(5-1)} = \\dfrac{3+2+0+1+1}{4*4}= \\dfrac{7}{16}= 0.438\\]\nThe indegree centralization score for our example graph is 0.438. What does this mean?\nRecall that when degree centrality is evenly dispersed, meaning that all nodes have the same degree, then the numerator in the equation will be zero and the quotient will be close to 0. When there is considerable inequality in the degree centrality scores between nodes, the quotient will be closer to 1. Thus, closer to 1 indicates that the graph is hierarchically structured and closer to 0 means that the graph is more decentralized.\nWhen we introduce directionality, we have to alter our language a bit. When indegree centrality is evenly dispersed, meaning that all nodes receive the same number of ties, then the numerator in the equation will be zero and the quotient will be close to 0. Thus, closer to 1 indicates that the indegrees in the graph are hierarchically structured and closer to 0 means that the indegrees for the graph are more decentralized.\n\n\nOutdegree Centralization\nNow, let’s calculate the outdegree centralization score for our example graph. Recall our raw outdegree scores:\n\nJen = 1\nTom = 1\nBob = 2\nLeaf = 2\nJim = 2\n\nBob, Leaf, and Jim all have the largest degree at 2. This means that \\(C_D(n^*) = 2\\). Finally, recall that \\(g = 5\\) since we have 5 nodes.\nNow, all we have to do is plug in the values:\n\\[C_O =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g [C_O(n^*) - C_O(n_i)]}{[(g-1)(g-1)]} = \\dfrac{(2-1)+(2-1)+(2-2)+(2-2)+(2-2)}{(5-1)(5-1)} = \\dfrac{1+1+0+0+0}{4*4}= \\dfrac{2}{16}= 0.125\\]\nThe outdegree centralization score for our example graph is 0.125. What does this mean?\nAn outdegree centralization score close to 1 indicates that the outdegrees in the graph are hierarchically structured and closer to 0 means that the outdegrees for the graph are more decentralized.\n\nComparing Indegree and Outdegree Centralization\nThe indegree centralization score, \\(C_I\\), is 0.438 and the outdegree centralization score, \\(C_O\\), is 0.125. What does the difference tell us? It tells us that the outdegrees are more decentralized than the indegrees. Put another way, the indegrees are more centralized than are the outdegrees. Make sense? Think of it this way: there is more inequality in the way the indegrees are distributed than the way the outdegrees are distributed."

    "text": "Summary\nIn this chapter, we explored the concept of centrality, focusing specifically on degree centrality and its critical role in understanding network structures. We learned that degree centrality measures the number of direct connections a node has within a network, providing insights into which individuals or entities hold the most influence. Through examples like white-collar crime networks and online hate speech deplatforming, we saw how identifying central actors can inform targeted interventions. We also discussed the importance of standardizing degree centrality to compare nodes across different network sizes and examined how centralization reflects the overall structure and hierarchy of a network. Understanding both node-level and graph-level centrality allows crime analysts to more effectively analyze social networks, identify key players, and develop strategies for effective interventions. By mastering these concepts, crime analysts can apply degree centrality to real-world problems, enhancing their investigative capabilities. In the next chapter we will focus on a different conceptualization and operationalization of centrality: closeness.\n\n\n\n\nFreeman, Linton C. 1978/1979. “Centrality in Social Networks: Conceptual Clarification.” Social Networks 1 (3): 215–39.\n\n\nSmith, David. 2012. “Network Analysis of Corporate Fraud: The Case of Enron.” Journal of Criminal Justice Research 40 (3): 235–47.\n\n\nThomas, Daniel Robert, and Laila A.

    "text": "Case Study: Terror Networks and Closeness\nSageman (2004) studied global Islamist terrorist networks and demonstrated how individuals with high closeness centrality played a key role in maintaining the cohesion and communication efficiency within these decentralized groups. These key players, even though they may not have had the most direct connections (high degree centrality), were crucial in maintaining the operational efficiency of the network. By targeting those with high closeness centrality, counter-terrorism efforts were able to more effectively disrupt communication channels and reduce the operational capabilities of the group.\n\nCloseness Centrality Terms\nHow close is a node to other nodes? Closeness centrality measures how near a node is to the other nodes in the network. That is, how “close” the nodes are. What we mean by “close” will differ based on whether the graph is undirected or directed. But the conceptual definition is the same. How close nodes are in a graph is based on the inverse of the distance of each node to every other node.\nTerminology:\n\nA path is an edge or sequence of edges that connect two nodes.\nA geodesic is the shortest path between two nodes.\nThe distance, \\(d(n_i,n_j)\\), is the length of the path between i and j.\n\nAnother way of saying this is that if we know how “far apart” two nodes are (i.e. the distance), then we can take the inverse of that and know how “close” the nodes are to each other."

    "section": "Undirected Graphs",
    "text": "Undirected Graphs\n\nCloseness Centrality\nFor an undirected binary graph, the closeness is:\n\\[C_C(n_i) = [\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)]^{-1}\\]\nThis reads as: Find the distance between two nodes i and j, \\(d(n_i,n_j)\\), sum them, and then take the inverse.\nAnother way to write this is as:\n\\[C_C(n_i) = [\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{[\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)]}\\]\nIn words, the closeness is 1 divided by the sum of the distances (called the reciprocal).\nTo find the closeness centrality score, we need to first find the distances between each node. We can express these distances using a matrix, just like we did with the sociomatrix before.\nLet’s take a look at this with some data. Recall our example network with Jen, Tom, Bob, Leaf, and Jim:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow far is Jen from Tom? How far is Jen from Bob? In other words, how many edges do we count in going from Jen to Tom? From Jen to Bob?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our graph, we want to first build a distance matrix which shows the value of the geodesic (i.e. shortest path) from i to j. We can do this by looking at each node and seeing the fewest steps that are needed to reach another node. We can see that Jen can reach Tom in 1 step (i.e. \\(L_{Jen,Tom}\\)) and that Jen can reach Bob in 2 steps (i.e. \\(L_{Jen,Tom}\\) & \\(L_{Tom,Bob}\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the graph is undirected, the distance matrix is symmetric about the diagonal (just like we saw with an adjacency matrix). That is, \\(d(n_i,n_j) = d(n_j,n_i)\\). This gives us:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, what about the rest of the distance matrix? If we follow what we did above for everyone else, then we get the following distance matrix:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, if we take the sum of the rows, this gives us \\(\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)\\). Note that since the graph is undirected, the column sum would give us the same values. Since we have \\(\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)\\), all we need to do now is take the reciprocal by dividing 1 by \\(\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)\\):\n\\[C_C(n_i) =  \\frac{1}{[\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)]}\\]\nThat gives us the closeness centrality score for each individual:\n\n\n\nNode\nDistance\nCloseness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n9\n1/9 = 0.111\n\n\nTom\n6\n1/6 = 0.167\n\n\nBob\n5\n1/5 = 0.200\n\n\nLeaf\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n\n\nJim\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardization\nAs discussed in the prior chapter, centrality measures are sensitive to the size of the graph, g. In the case of closeness centrality, having to sum over more nodes will push scores closer to zero. Think about it: if we added more rows and columns to our distance matrix, that will increase the denominator, making the quotient smaller. This means that we can’t compare closeness centrality scores across graphs of different sizes. Solution?\nStandardize! If we want to compare nodes in different sized networks, then we just take into account the number of nodes and the maximum possible nodes to which i could be connected. In an undirected graph, this is g-1.\nThus, we can calculate a standardized closeness centrality for an undirected graph as:\n\\[C'_C(n_i) = [\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)]^{-1} \\times [g-1]\\]\nFor this graph, the denominator, g-1 is \\(5 - 1 = 4\\). Plugging that in we get: \\(C'_C(n_i) = [\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)]^{-1} \\times 4\\).\n\n\n\nNode\nDistance\nCloseness\nStandardized Closeness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n9\n1/9 = 0.111\n0.111*4 = 0.444\n\n\nTom\n6\n1/6 = 0.167\n0.167*4 = 0.668\n\n\nBob\n5\n1/5 = 0.200\n0.200*4 = 0.800\n\n\nLeaf\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n0.143*4 = 0.572\n\n\nJim\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n0.143*4 = 0.572\n\n\n\nStandardization is particularly important with closeness centrality because of the sensitivity of the measure to the size of the network. Take for example, the following networks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above shows two different graphs with the raw closeness centrality scores for two nodes. Note that they have the exact same score. Yet, would you say they are equally close to other nodes in the network? In other words, that their closeness to other nodes is the same?\nWhen we standardize, we adjust for the size of the network:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, apply the same thing to the rest of the network:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean Closeness\nWe can examine the summary statistics for closeness centrality by inspecting the mean. The average closeness is an important property of a network. Why? What does a network with a high average closeness look like? A low average closeness?\nThe mean closeness for an undirected network is:\n\\[\\bar C_C =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_C(n_i)}{g}\\]\nThis equation, \\(\\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_C(n_i)}{g}\\), just says to sum up the closeness scores for each node and then divide by the number of nodes, g.\nWhat is the mean closeness for our example network? We can pull these from the table above:\n\n\n\nNode\nDistance\nCloseness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n9\n1/9 = 0.111\n\n\nTom\n6\n1/6 = 0.167\n\n\nBob\n5\n1/5 = 0.200\n\n\nLeaf\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n\n\nJim\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n\n\n\n\\[\\bar C_C =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_C(n_i)}{g} = \\dfrac{0.111 + 0.167 + 0.200 + 0.143 + 0.143}{5} = \\dfrac{0.764}{5} = 0.153\\] The average closeness for this graph is 0.153. In other words, on average, a node has a closeness score of 0.153. But what does this mean?\nOne way to interpret this score is to convert the score to a distance. We can do this be taking 1 as the numerator and our mean closeness score as the denominator: \\[\\dfrac{1}{0.153} = 6.536\\], which tells us that the average node is 6.5 links away from all the other nodes in the graph.\n\n\nCloseness Centralization\nIn the prior chapter we discussed graph centralization, which measures the extent to which the nodes in a network differ from one another in their individual centrality scores. Put differently, how much variation is there in the distribution of centrality scores? As with degree centralization, we can calculate the closeness centralization of the graph. A key difference, however, is that for closeness centralization, we use the standardized closeness score.\nWe can calculate closeness centralization as:\n\\[C_C = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g[C'_C(n^*)-C'_C(n_i)]}{[(g-2)(g-1)]/(2g-3)}\\] This may look imposing, but we can decompose it to see what it is doing:\n\n\\(C'_C(n^*)\\) is the largest standardized closeness score\n\\(C'_C(n_i)\\) is the standardized closeness score for node i\n\\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g[C'_C(n^*)-C'_C(n_i)]\\) simply takes the sum of deviations for each node from the largest value\nFinally, we take that sum and divide it by \\([(g-2)(g-1)]/(2g-3)\\)\n\nIf I lost you in some of the math, don’t worry. Let’s calculate the closeness centralization score for our example graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall our table of standardized closeness scores:\n\n\n\nNode\nDistance\nCloseness\nStandardized Closeness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n9\n1/9 = 0.111\n0.111*4 = 0.444\n\n\nTom\n6\n1/6 = 0.167\n0.167*4 = 0.668\n\n\nBob\n5\n1/5 = 0.200\n0.200*4 = 0.800\n\n\nLeaf\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n0.143*4 = 0.572\n\n\nJim\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n0.143*4 = 0.572\n\n\n\nWhat is the largest standardized closeness score? It is 0.8 for Bob. Also, we have \\(g = 5\\). Now, we just plug these into our equation:\n\\[C_C = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g[0.800-C'_C(n_i)]}{[(5-2)(5-1)]/(2*5-3)}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode\nDistance\nCloseness\nStandardized Closeness\nDeviations of Standardized Closeness \\(0.800-C'_C(n_i)\\)\n\n\n\n\nJen\n9\n1/9 = 0.111\n0.111*4 = 0.444\n0.800 - 0.444 = 0.356\n\n\nTom\n6\n1/6 = 0.167\n0.167*4 = 0.668\n0.800 - 0.668 = 0.132\n\n\nBob\n5\n1/5 = 0.200\n0.200*4 = 0.800\n0.800 - 0.800 = 0.000\n\n\nLeaf\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n0.143*4 = 0.572\n0.800 - 0.572 = 0.228\n\n\nJim\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n0.143*4 = 0.572\n0.800 - 0.572 = 0.228\n\n\n\nNow, if we total all of the values in the last column we get 0.944. Plugging this in as our numerator, we get:\n\\[C_C = \\frac{0.944}{[(5-2)(5-1)]/(2*5-3)} = \\frac{0.944}{1.714} = 0.5507585 \\approx 0.551\\]\nSo, the closeness centralization score for our example graph is 0.551. What does this mean?\nWhen closeness centrality is evenly dispersed, meaning that all nodes have the same closeness score, then the numerator in the equation will be zero and the quotient will be close to 0. When there is considerable inequality in the closeness centrality scores between nodes, the quotient will be closer to 1. Thus, closer to 1 indicates that the graph is hierarchically structured and closer to 0 means that the graph is more decentralized.\nWe can see this by examining two additional undirected networks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe closeness centralization score for the figure on the left is 1, whereas the closeness centralization score for the figure on the right is 0."

    "text": "Directed Graphs\nAs was covered in the prior chapter, when we have a directed graph, we have to consider directionality when evaluating a centrality measure. For example, in the graph below, how far is Jen from Tom? How far is Jen from Bob?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer this question, let’s think again about what closeness measures. It is the inverse of the distance matrix. So, if we are looking at outgoing ties (i.e. \\(L(n_i,n_j)\\)) then our equation is the same for the undirected graph:\n\\[C_C(n_i) = [\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{[\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)]}\\]\nNote, however, that the distance of i to j, \\(d(n_i,n_j)\\), does not necessarily equal the distance from j to i, \\(d(n_j,n_i)\\). For example, the distance from Jen to Tom, \\(d(Jen,Tom)\\), is 1. But, the distance from Tom to Jen, \\(d(Tom,Jen)\\) is….? It is undefined because there is not an edge that originates from Tom and ends at Jen. This complicates things a bit. Let’s work through an example to see what this looks like.\n\nOutdegree\nCloseness centrality in directed graphs usually focuses on the send network (i.e. outgoing ties). Remember, row sums are the outdegree, so row distance tells you how close you are to others. That is, how many steps it takes you to reach another node.\nAs before, we want to first build a distance matrix which shows the value of the geodesic (i.e. shortest path) from i to j.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow far is Jen from Tom? How far is Jen from Bob? To figure this out, we can simply count the steps from Jen to Tom. Then Jen to Bob.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJen is 1 step from Tom and 2 steps from Bob. What about the rest of the scores for Jen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, recall that we sum these distances, and then take the reciprocal:\n\\[C_C(Jen) =  \\frac{1}{[\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(Jen,n_j)]} = \\frac{1}{9} = 0.111\\]\nWhat about Bob? How far is Bob from everyone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow far is Bob from Jen? Bob, is “infinite distance” from Jen because there is not a directed path by which he can reach her. This is also the case for the distance from Bob to Tom. But, Bob does have directed ties to Jim and Leaf. With directionality in mind, they are unreachable. But, Bob is 1 step from Leaf and 1 step from Jim along a directed path:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what is Bob’s closeness centrality score? If we do not count the cells that have “infinite distance”, and only count cells where there are values, then we just count the distance for Leaf and Jim, which sums to 2. We just plug this in:\n\\[C_C(Bob) =  \\frac{1}{[\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(Bob,n_j)]} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.500\\]\nNote that this changes the denominator for each node.\nIf we fill in our matrix, then we have the following distance values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing through the rest of the matrix, we get a closeness centrality score for each individual:\n\n\n\nNode\nDistance\nCloseness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n9\n1/9 = 0.111\n\n\nTom\n5\n1/5 = 0.200\n\n\nBob\n2\n1/2 = 0.500\n\n\nLeaf\n2\n1/2 = 0.500\n\n\nJim\n2\n1/2 = 0.500\n\n\n\n\nStandardization\nDon’t forget: raw centrality scores are sensitive to the size of the graph. So, as before, we can standardize our closeness score as:\n\\[C'_C(n_i) = [\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)]^{-1} \\times [g-1]\\]\n\n\n\nNode\nDistance\nCloseness\nStandardized Closeness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n9\n1/9 = 0.111\n0.111*4 = 0.444\n\n\nTom\n5\n1/5 = 0.200\n0.200*4 = 0.800\n\n\nBob\n2\n1/2 = 0.500\n0.500*4 = 0.200\n\n\nLeaf\n2\n1/2 = 0.500\n0.500*4 = 0.200\n\n\nJim\n2\n1/2 = 0.500\n0.500*4 = 0.200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean Clonessness\nAs we did above for an undirected graph, we can examine the average closeness for a directed graph, as this is an important property of a network. Why? What does a network with a high average closeness look like? A low average closeness?\nThe mean closeness for an directed network is:\n\\[\\bar C_C =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_C(n_i)}{g}\\]\nThis equation, \\(\\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_C(n_i)}{g}\\), just says to sum up the closeness scores for each node and then divide by the number of nodes, g.\nWhat is the mean closeness for our example network? We can pull these from the table above:\n\n\n\nNode\nDistance\nCloseness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n9\n1/9 = 0.111\n\n\nTom\n5\n1/5 = 0.200\n\n\nBob\n2\n1/2 = 0.500\n\n\nLeaf\n2\n1/2 = 0.500\n\n\nJim\n2\n1/2 = 0.500\n\n\n\n\\[\\bar C_C =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_C(n_i)}{g} = \\dfrac{0.111 + 0.200 + 0.500 + 0.500 + 0.500}{5} = \\dfrac{1.811}{5} = 0.362\\] The average closeness for this graph is 0.362. In other words, on average, a node has a closeness score of 0.362. But what does this mean?\nAgain, one way to interpret this score is to convert the score to a distance. We can do this be taking 1 as the numerator and our mean closeness score as the denominator: \\[\\dfrac{1}{0.362} = 2.762\\], which tells us that the average node is nearly links away from all the other nodes in the graph.\n\n\nIndegree\nNote that in the prior section we were looking at outdegree. When we are looking at outgoing ties the closeness scores reflect how close you are to other nodes. For example, Tom’s distance to Leaf is 2, meaning that it takes 2 outgoing ties to reach Leaf. What about the other way around? We can reverse this and look at the incoming ties by focusing on indegree. Remember, column sums are the indegree, so column distance tells you how close others are to you. That is, how many steps it takes a node to reach you. The difference is a bit nuanced, but meaningful. In this case, instead of summing the rows as we did above, we could sum the columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we sum the columns, then we get these scores:\n\n\n\nNode\nDistance\nCloseness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n0\n1/0 = Undefined\n\n\nTom\n1\n1/1 = 1.000\n\n\nBob\n5\n1/5 = 0.200\n\n\nLeaf\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n\n\nJim\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n\n\n\n\nStandardization\nWe can then standardize our closeness score as:\n\\[C'_C(n_i) = [\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^g d(n_i,n_j)]^{-1} \\times [g-1]\\]\n\n\n\nNode\nDistance\nCloseness\nStandardized Closeness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n0\n1/0 = Undefined\nUndefined*4 = Undefined\n\n\nTom\n1\n1/1 = 1.000\n1.000*4 = 4.000\n\n\nBob\n5\n1/5 = 0.200\n0.200*4 = 0.800\n\n\nLeaf\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n0.143*4 = 0.571\n\n\nJim\n7\n1/7 = 0.143\n0.143*4 = 0.571\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversion to Undirected Graph\nNOTE: While these are correct, mathematically, they are far less intuitive than the scores we calculated based on the outgoing ties. For example, Tom’s closeness score is 1. But, Bob, Leaf, and Jim cannot reach him. Also, note that Tom’s standardized score is greater than 1. For these reasons, we often convert the directed graph to an undirected graph and calculate the scores on the undirected graph. In this case, the directed graph we have here would revert to the undirected graph we examined above in the section on undirected graphs.\n\n\nCloseness Centralization\nThe denominator for group closeness centralization is not defined for directed graphs. To get a centralization score, we would just convert it to an undirected graph and calculate the score. Note that, unlike with degree centralization which has two scores (i.e. indegree centralization and outdegree centralization), there is only a single centralization score for a directed graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the graph above, we can compare the centralization scores based on the different measures of centrality. The indegree centralization score is 0.428, the outdegree centralization score is 0.125, and the closeness centralization score is 0.556. What can we say about the closeness centralization scores for each type of centrality?"

Unlike degree centrality, which measures direct connections, closeness centrality provides insight into the influence and access a node has through indirect connections. Studies, such as the analysis of drug trafficking and terrorist networks, have shown that individuals with high closeness centrality, though not necessarily the most directly connected, play crucial roles in maintaining communication and operational efficiency. In the next chapter we will focus on a final conceptualization and operationalization of centrality: betweenness.\n\n\n\n\nBright, David A., Caitlin E.

Using betweenness centrality to assess how well-positioned launderers were within the network, Malm and Bichler (2011) found that self-launderers generally exhibited higher betweenness centrality, showing they often acted as key brokers facilitating information flow and transactions across different parts of the network. The findings suggested that targeting individuals with high betweenness centrality, particularly those involved in self-laundering, may be most effective for disrupting drug networks."

Let’s unpack it:\n\nThe denominator, \\(g_{jk}\\), is the number of geodesics linking j to k.\nThe numerator, \\(g_{jk}(n_i)\\), is the number of geodesics linking j and k that contain i.\n\nBetweenness centrality is the ratio of the geodesics between j and k that contain i.\n\nIn words, if j has to go through i to reach k, \\(j-i-k\\), then i will have high betweenness because i is between j and k.\nLet’s consider an example.

He is between Jen and Jim on both paths. Note, however, that only one of the paths is a geodesic path (the Jen-&gt;Tom-&gt;Bob-&gt;Jim path). That is because it is shorter.\nNow, let’s calculate the betweenness centrality for Bob. The first thing we need to find are the geodesic paths. Then, figure out how many of those geodesic paths contain Bob.

In the case of betweenness centrality, having to sum over more nodes will make scores from large networks bigger than scores from smaller networks (because you are just summing over more nodes). This means that we can’t compare betweenness centrality scores across graphs of different sizes. Solution?\nStandardize! If we want to compare nodes in different sized graphs, then we just take into account the number of nodes and the maximum possible nodes to which i could be connected. For betweenness centrality, we have to go a step further. We need to account for the number of pairs of nodes that do not include i. In an undirected graph, this is \\((g-1))(g-2)/2\\).\nThus, we can calculate a standardized betweenness centrality score for an undirected graph as:\n\\[C'_B(n_i) = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{j&lt;k} g_{jk}(n_i) / g_{jk}}{[(g-1)(g-2)/2]} =  \\frac{C_B(n_i)}{[(g-1)(g-2)/2]}\\]\nSo, all we are doing is adjusting each betweenness score by \\((g-1))(g-2)/2\\).\nFor this graph, the denominator, \\((g-1))(g-2)/2=(5-1))(5-2)/2 = 6\\). Plugging that in we get: \\[C'_B(n_i) = \\frac{C_B(n_i)}{6}\\].\nWhen we calculate the raw betweenness scores, we get the following table:\n\n\n\nNode\nBetweenness\nStandardized Betweenness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n\n\nTom\n3\n3 / 6 = 0.500\n\n\nBob\n4\n4 / 6 = 0.667\n\n\nLeaf\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n\n\nJim\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n\n\n\n\n\nMean Betweenness\nWe can examine the summary statistics for betweenness centrality by inspecting the mean. The average betweenness is an important property of a network. Why? What does a network with a high average betweenness look like? A low average closeness?\nThe mean betweenness for an undirected network is:\n\\[\\bar C_B =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_B(n_i)}{g}\\]\nThis equation, \\(\\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_B(n_i)}{g}\\), just says to sum up the betweeness scores for each node and then divide by the number of nodes, g.\nWhat is the mean betweenness for our example network? We can pull these from the table above:\n\n\n\nNode\nBetweenness\nStandardized Betweenness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n\n\nTom\n3\n3 / 6 = 0.500\n\n\nBob\n4\n4 / 6 = 0.667\n\n\nLeaf\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n\n\nJim\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n\n\n\n\\[\\bar C_B =  \\dfrac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g C_B(n_i)}{g} = \\dfrac{0 + 3 + 4 + 0 + 0}{5} = \\dfrac{7}{5} = 1.4\\] The average betweenness for this graph is 1.4, which tells us that the average node occupies just over 1 path which other nodes have to go through.\n\n\nBetweenness Centralization\nAs we did with degree centralization and closeness centralization, we can calculate the betweenness centralization of the graph. Recall that centralization measures the extent to which the nodes in a social network differ from one another in their individual centrality scores. Put differently, how much variation is there in the distribution of centrality scores? As with closeness centralization, we use the standardized betweenness score (as opposed to the raw score).\nWe can calculate betweenness centralization as:\n\\[C_B = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g[C'_B(n^*)-C'_B(n_i)]}{(g-1)} \\]\nIf I lost you in some of the math, don’t worry. Let’s calculate the betweenness centralization score for our example graph. Recall our table of standardized betweenness scores:\n\n\n\nNode\nBetweenness\nStandardized Betweenness\n\n\n\n\nJen\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n\n\nTom\n3\n3 / 6 = 0.500\n\n\nBob\n4\n4 / 6 = 0.667\n\n\nLeaf\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n\n\nJim\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n\n\n\nWhat is the largest standardized betweenness score? It is 0.667 for Bob. Also, we have \\(g-1 = 5 - 1 = 4\\). Now, we just plug these into our equation:\n\\[C_B = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^g[0.667-C'_B(n_i)]}{4} \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode\nBetweenness\nStandardized Betweenness\nDeviations of Betweenness Closeness, \\(0.667-C'_B(n_i)\\)\n\n\n\n\nJen\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n0.667 - 0.000 = 0.667\n\n\nTom\n3\n3 / 6 = 0.500\n0.667 - 0.500 = 0.167\n\n\nBob\n4\n4 / 6 = 0.667\n0.667 - 0.667 = 0.000\n\n\nLeaf\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n0.667 - 0.000 = 0.667\n\n\nJim\n0\n0 / 6 = 0.000\n0.667 - 0.000 = 0.667\n\n\n\nIf we total all of the values in the last column we get 2.168. Plugging this in as our numerator, we get:\n\\[C_B = \\frac{2.168}{4} = 0.542\\]\nSo, the betweenness centralization score for our example graph is 0.542. What does this mean?\nWhen betweenness centrality is evenly dispersed, meaning that all nodes have the same betweenness score, then the numerator in the equation will be zero and the quotient will be close to 0. When there is considerable inequality in the betweenness centrality scores between nodes, the quotient will be closer to 1. Thus, closer to 1 indicates that the graph is hierarchically structured and closer to 0 means that the graph is more decentralized.\nWe can see this by examining two additional undirected networks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe betweenness centralization score for the figure on the left is 1, whereas the betweenness centralization score for the figure on the right is 0. This makes sense. In the figure on the left, every node has to go between the node in the middle. The node in the middle is on every geodesic in the graph. In contrast, for the graph on the right, every node has a betweenness centrality score of 1, so there is no variation in betweenness centrality scores."

Unlike degree or closeness centrality, betweenness highlights actors who control connectivity between groups, making it particularly valuable in analyzing criminal networks, where key figures often facilitate collaboration. We covered how to calculate betweenness centrality for individual nodes, standardize these scores for comparison across network sizes, and compute a network-wide betweenness centralization score, which reveals the structural cohesion of a network. Understanding these concepts equips analysts to assess both individual influence and the overall structure of networks.\nWe have now covered three different ways of conceptualizing centrality: degree, closeness, and betweenness.

    "section": "Bipartite Graphs: Notation",
    "text": "Bipartite Graphs: Notation\nA bipartite graph has two partitions of nodes (called modes), and edges only occur between these partitions (i.e. not within). The definition of a bipartite graph is the following: \\(G = (N,M,L)\\) where \\(G\\) is the graph and is defined by:\n\nNode set \\(N = \\{n_1, n_2…, n_g\\}\\)\nNode set: \\(M = \\{m_1, m_2…, m_g\\}\\)\nLine/Edge set: \\(L = \\{l_1, l_2…, l_L\\}\\)\n\nIn this definition, there are \\(N\\) nodes in the first set, \\(M\\) nodes in the second set, and \\(L\\) lines/edges in the graph.\nWe can visualize an example as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we can define all of pieces of the graph using our definition above:\n\nNode set \\(N = \\{n_A, n_B, n_C, n_D, n_E, n_F \\}\\)\nNode set: \\(M = \\{m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5 \\}\\)\nLine/Edge set: \\(L = \\{l_1, l_2…, l_{12} \\}\\)\n\n\nAdjacency\nAs discussed in the Network Data Structures chapter, we define two nodes, \\(n_i\\) and \\(n_j\\) as adjacent if there is a link \\(l_k = (n_i,n_j)\\). We then went on to show that these data can be represented as an adjacency matrix, where each node is listed on the row and the column. The \\(i_{th}\\) row and the \\(j_{th}\\) column of \\(X_{ij}\\) records the value of a tie from i to j.\nIn bipartite graphs, we can also use an adjacency matrix. But, we have to represent the two different sets of nodes \\(N\\) and \\(M\\). we define two nodes from separate node sets, \\(n_i\\) and \\(m_j\\) as adjacent if there is a link \\(l_k = (n_i,m_j)\\). The \\(i_{th}\\) row and the \\(j_{th}\\) column of \\(X_{ij}\\) records the value of a tie from \\(n_i\\) to \\(m_j\\). Note the difference. That is, \\(N\\) (the first mode) is listed on the rows and \\(M\\) is listed on the columns of the adjacency matrix. As a consequence, the order of the matrix is \\(N \\times M\\), meaning that it has \\(N\\) rows and \\(M\\) columns. Thus, if the number of nodes in \\(N\\) is not equal to the number of nodes in \\(M\\), we have a rectangular matrix (as opposed to a square matrix when the order is equal, as with unipartite graphs).\nLet’s take our example network above and build the adjacency matrix:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach column corresponds to the edges incident on a node, \\(m_i\\), from the set \\(M\\). The set of nodes \\(M\\) usually corresponds to an event, group, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach row corresponds to the edges incident on a node, \\(n_j\\), from the set \\(N\\). The set of nodes \\(N\\) usually corresponds to a person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a question: what does \\(l_k = (n_i,n_i)\\) represent in a unipartite graph? What does \\(l_k = (n_i,m_i)\\) represent in a bipartite graph?\nIn a unipartite graph, \\(l_k = (n_i,n_i)\\) would represent an edge from \\(n_i\\) to \\(n_i\\). This is called a loop and it represents a self-nomination. Recall from the chapter on unipartite data structures that we usually set these elements of the matrix to zero.\nHowever, in a bipartite graph, \\(l_k = (n_i,m_i)\\) would represent an edge from \\(n_i\\) to \\(m_i\\). That is, a link between the ith row and the ith column. For example, in the graph above, the line \\(l_k = (n_A,m_1)\\) has a value 1 meaning that node A in the \\(N\\) node set is connected to node 1 in the \\(M\\) node set."

    "section": "Bipartite Graphs: Properties",
    "text": "Bipartite Graphs: Properties\nThere are several approaches to examining bipartite graphs. Either we can keep the graph bipartite and examine the properties (as discussed below). Or, what is commonly done is that we project the graph to one mode (either N or M) and examine the properties. We will examine projection in the next chapter. Here, let’s see what properties we can describe for a biparite graph (i.e. a two-mode network).\nAs with unipartite graphs, we can describe the structure of the network in various ways. Examples:\n\nHow dense is the graph? (Density)\nHow are the edges distributed over nodes? (Degree Centrality)\nWhat is the average centrality score? (Mean Degree Centrality)\n\n\nDensity: Bipartite Graphs\nThe density of a bipartite graph is the number of edges observed \\(L\\), divided by the number of possible pairwise relations between the node sets \\(N\\) and \\(M\\). The number of possible connections between the nodes is \\(N \\times M\\). Thus, the density is:\n\\[\\frac{L}{N \\times M}\\]\nWhat is the density of our example network?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, calculate the number of edges \\(L\\). This is just the sum over the rows and columns of the matrix. In our example, \\(L = 12\\).\nSecond, we need to calculate the denominator. This is \\(N \\times M = 6 = 5 = 30\\).\nTherefore, our calculation for the density is:\n\\[\\frac{L}{N \\times M} = \\frac{12}{6 \\times 5}= \\frac{12}{30} = 0.4\\]\nWhat does it mean to say that the density of the network is 0.4?\nIt tells us that 40% of the edges that could occur in the network did occur. In other words, 60% of the edges that could have occurred were not observed.\n\n\nDegree Centrality: Bipartite Graphs\nRecall from the Degree Centrality chapter that for an undirected graph there is one degree distribution and for a directed graph there are two degree distributions (i.e. indegree and outdegree). A bipartite graph also has two degree distributions:\n\nThe distribution of ties over nodes in the first mode, \\(N\\)\nThe distribution of ties over nodes in the second mode, \\(M\\)\n\nWe can calculate each degree using the adjacency matrix. The row sum for the adjacency matrix gives the degree centrality scores for the first mode, \\(N\\). The column sum for the adjacency matrix gives the degree centrality scores for the second mode, \\(M\\). Thus, we have:\n\n\\(C_D(N_i) = \\sum_j x_{ij}\\) and\n\\(C_D(M_i) = \\sum_j x_{ji}\\)\n\nWhat are the degree centrality scores for our example network?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get the scores for the nodes in \\(N\\), we calculate the row sums. For example, for node A in \\(N\\), we sum across the rows:\n\\(C_D(N_A) = \\sum_j x_{A,j} = x_{A, 1} + x_{A, 2} + x_{A, 3} + x_{A, 4} + x_{A, 5} = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2\\)\nThe degree centrality score for node A in \\(N\\) is 2. This means that A is connected to 2 nodes in \\(M\\).\nDoing this for all the nodes we get:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get the scores for the nodes in \\(M\\), we calculate the column sums. For example, for node 1 in \\(M\\), we sum across the columns:\n\\(C_D(M_1) = \\sum_j x_{1,i} = x_{1, A} + x_{1, B} + x_{1, C} + x_{1, D} + x_{1, E} + x_{1, F} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3\\)\nThe degree centrality score for node 1 in \\(M\\) is 3. This means that 1 is connected to # nodes in \\(N\\).\nDoing this for all the nodes we get:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardization\nAs discussed in all the chapters on centrality, centrality scores for each node set depend on the number of nodes in the graph. Larger networks will have a higher maximum possible degree centrality value simply because there are more nodes with whom to connect. Solution?\nStandardize! (This should be an automatic response for you by now). As before, we need to adjust the raw degree centrality scores to produce a standardized degree centrality score. We can account for differences across networks by dividing each degree centrality score by the number of nodes in the opposite set:\n\nFor \\(N\\), we divide by \\(M\\)\nFor \\(M\\), we divide by \\(N\\)\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\(C'_D(N_i) = \\dfrac{C_D(N_i)}{M}\\) and\n\\(C'_D(M_i) = \\dfrac{C_D(M_i)}{N}\\)\n\nWhat are the standardized degree centrality scores for the nodes in \\(N\\)? All we need to do is divide \\(C_D(N_i)\\) by \\(M\\), which is 5.\nFor node A in \\(N\\), we have \\(C'_D(N_A) = 2 / 5 = 0.4\\). What does this score mean?\nA standardized degree centrality score of 0.4 means that node A in \\(N\\) is connected to 40% of the nodes in \\(M\\).\nLet’s finish standardizing the rest of the scores:\n\n\n\nNode\nRaw\nStandardized\n\n\n\n\nA\n2\n2 / 5 = 0.4\n\n\nB\n1\n1 / 5 = 0.2\n\n\nC\n2\n2 / 5 = 0.4\n\n\nD\n4\n4 / 5 = 0.8\n\n\nE\n1\n1 / 5 = 0.2\n\n\nF\n2\n2 / 5 = 0.4\n\n\n\nWhat are the standardized degree centrality scores for the nodes in \\(M\\)? All we need to do is divide \\(C_D(M_i)\\) by \\(N\\), which is 6.\nFor node 1 in \\(M\\), we have \\(C'_D(M_1) = 3 / 6 = 0.5\\). What does this score mean?\nA standardized degree centrality score of 0.5 means that node 1 in \\(M\\) is connected to 50% of the nodes in \\(N\\).\nLet’s finish standardizing the rest of the scores:\n\n\n\nNode\nRaw\nStandardized\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n3 / 6 = 0.5\n\n\n2\n3\n3 / 6 = 0.5\n\n\n3\n3\n3 / 6 = 0.5\n\n\n4\n1\n1 / 6 = 0.167\n\n\n5\n2\n2 / 6 = 0.334\n\n\n\n\n\nMean Degree Centrality: Bipartite Graphs\nAs discussed in the Degree Centrality chapter, we can summarize degree centrality scores by taking the mean. This tells us, on average, how many edges are incident on a node and helps us get a sense of how connected the network is, overall. With bipartite graphs we can also do this, we simply calculate the mean degree for each node set:\n\nFor the mean of \\(N\\), or \\(\\bar C_D(N)\\), we divide by \\(\\frac{L}{N}\\) and\nFor the mean of \\(M\\), or \\(\\bar C_D(M)\\), we divide by \\(\\frac{L}{M}\\)\n\nNote that for the mean we use the number of nodes in the corresponding node set. Above, when we standardized, we used the opposite node set. Just keep this in mind when doing the calculations.\nWhat is the mean degree centrality score for each node set?\nTo do this we simply take the number of edges, \\(L\\), and divide by the corresponding size of the node sets. We know from our calculation of the density above that \\(L = 12\\). So, that gives us:\n\n\\(\\bar C_D(N) = 12 / 6 = 2\\) and\n\\(\\bar C_D(M) = 12 / 5 = 2.4\\)\n\nWhat are we to make of these numbers? In the node set \\(N\\), the average degree centrality score is 2. In the node set \\(M\\), the average degree centrality score is 2.4.\nSince we have two sets of nodes, we can compare the means. The average node in \\(M\\) has a higher degree than the average node in \\(N\\). This makes sense given that the edge count is the same. As a rule, in bipartite graphs, the node set with more nodes will have a higher mean degree."

Unlike unipartite graphs, which focus on a single set of nodes, bipartite graphs allow analysts to conceptualize and operationalize networks where ties exist only between nodes of different sets. Through examples like shared-incident networks among police officers, the chapter illustrated how interactions within these networks can influence attitudes and behaviors, such as the adoption and use of body-worn cameras. Key concepts we covered include representing bipartite networks using adjacency matrices, calculating metrics such as density and degree centrality, and understanding their implications. For crime analysts, mastering bipartite networks is essential for unraveling complex relational data, assessing connections between entities like suspects and criminal events, and gaining insights into the broader social structures influencing crime and enforcement outcomes. In the next chapter, we will examine projection, whereby we convert a bipartite graph into a unipartite graph.

    "text": "Projection: Terminology and Conceptual Aspects\nBipartite networks can be represented using an adjacency matrix where the rows and columns correspond to the separate sets of nodes \\(N\\) and \\(M\\), respectively. While the Bipartite Graphs/Two-Mode Networks chapter discussed ways to examine such an adjacency matrix, a very common approach in research is to reduce the bipartite graph to a unipartite graph. This is done for several reasons, but the main reason is that there are more analytic tools available for examining a single set of nodes. Projection is the process by which we map the connectivity between modes to a single mode.\nFor example, let’s say we have a two-mode network of people (\\(N\\)) in groups (\\(M\\)). By projecting, we get either:\n\nA one-mode network of people connected to people by groups (an \\(N \\times N\\) adjacency matrix) and/or\nA one-mode network of groups connected by people (an \\(M \\times M\\) adjacency matrix).\n\nWe can see this graphically by taking a look at our example network from the Bipartite Graphs/Two-Mode Networks chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider nodes A, B, and C. Are they connected?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that A, B, and C are connected through the shared edges with node 1. That is, the edges \\(L_{A,1}\\) and \\(L_{B,1}\\) connect nodes A and B.

    "text": "Building the Projection\nIn an influential paper titled The Duality of Persons and Groups, Breiger (1974) proved mathematically that we can build the adjacency matrix for each projected network through matrix algebra. (YAY!). If you are unfamiliar with matrix algebra, that is fine. It is simply using mathematical expressions on matrices (e.g. adding two matrices, or multiplying two matrices). Since the bipartite graph represents two nodes sets, we can create two unipartite graphs: a “people” network and a “group” network. The “people” network is the connections between the \\(N\\) nodes and the “group” network is the connections between the \\(M\\) nodes.\nLet’s make this more concrete. We create these projections by multiplying an adjacency matrix by it’s transpose. The transpose of a matrix simply reverses the columns and rows:\n\\[A^T_{ij} = A_{ji}\\]\nHere, the \\(T\\) in the superscript is used to indicate the transpose of the matrix \\(A\\). Note that all we do is switch the columns and rows.\nA two-mode \\(N \\times M\\) adjacency matrix, can be projected to:\n\nA \\(M \\times M\\) matrix (ties among \\(M\\) nodes via \\(N\\)) and/or\nA \\(N \\times N\\) matrix (ties among \\(N\\) nodes via \\(M\\))\n\nLet’s take our example network above and look at this a bit closer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that our matrix, \\(A\\), has 6 rows and 5 columns. This means it has order \\(6 \\times 5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall, that the transpose of a matrix simply reverses the columns and rows. To get the transpose, imagine rotating the matrix 90 degrees, and then flipping it over. That would give us this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the transpose, \\(A^T\\), the rows and columns have been switched. We now have 5 rows and 6 columns. This means it has order \\(5 \\times 6\\).\nSo what?\nWe need to briefly review some rules about matrix multiplication to understand why the emphasis on order is important.\n\nMatrix Multiplication Rules\nTo multiply two matrices, the number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second matrix. For example:\n\n\\(5 \\times 6\\) X \\(6 \\times 5\\) works,\nbut \\(5 \\times 6\\) X \\(5 \\times 6\\) does not work.\n\nThe rule is that the “inner numbers must match”, meaning that the two inside numbers (the number of columns in the first matrix and the number of rows in the second matrix) must be the same.\n\nProduct Matrix\nWhen we multiply two matrices, we get the product matrix. The product matrix has the number of rows equal to the first matrix and the number of columns equal to the second matrix. For example: \\(5 \\times 6\\) X \\(6 \\times 5\\) = \\(5 \\times 5\\).\nThe product matrix is the projected graph. Recall that there are two potential product matrices we can create:\n\n\\(A \\times A^T\\) (what Breiger (1974) called the “people” matrix, \\(P\\)) and\nThe \\(A^T \\times A\\) (what Breiger (1974) called the “group” matrix \\(G\\))\n\nWhat does each one represent?\nTo answer this question, let’s work on creating the projections!\n\n\n\n“People” Matrix\nTo create the “people” matrix, \\(P\\), which connects nodes in the the set \\(N\\), we perform the following matrix multiplication for our adjacency matrix \\(A\\):\n\\[A \\times A^T = P\\] Let’s see how this works by visualizing our example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter multiplication we get:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe product matrix as rows \\(N \\times N\\) shows us how people are connected by groups.\nThe values of the matrix show two important things:\n\nThe diagonal cells represents the count of ties that a specific node in \\(N\\) has with nodes in \\(M\\)\nThe off-diagonal cells count the number of ways that separate nodes in \\(N\\) are connected by nodes in \\(M\\)\n\nLet’s take a look at each of these points.\n\nDiagonal Cells\nThe diagonal tells us the count of ties that a specific node in \\(N\\) has with nodes in \\(M\\). Using the language of “groups” to refer to the \\(M\\) node set, the diagonal is the count of groups to which a node in \\(N\\) is connected.\nFor example, in the figure below, D is in 4 groups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see this in the graph by counting the edges, but also by looking at the \\(P_{D,D}\\) cell of the adjacency matrix \\(P\\) (highlighted in red).\nHere is a question. What network measure does the diagonal give us? Think back to the chapter on Bipartite Graphs/Two-Mode Networks. It is the degree centrality score!\n\n\nOff-Diagonal Cells\nThe off-diagonal cells count the number of ways that separate nodes in \\(N\\) are connected by nodes in \\(M\\). Using the language of “people” to refer to the \\(N\\) node set, the off-diagonal represents the count of other people to whom a node in \\(N\\) is connected.\nFor example, in the figure below, nodes A and B are linked through a single node, 1. This means the value for the \\(P_{A,B}\\) cell of the adjacency matrix \\(P\\) (highlighted in green) is 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that when we project, it forces the matrix to be symmetric. This means that the projection creates an undirected unipartite graph. As a result, the value for the \\(P_{B,A}\\) cell of the adjacency matrix \\(P\\) (also highlighted in green) is 1.\nLet’s look at another example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, A and C are linked through two nodes in \\(M\\), 1 and 2. This means that the value for the \\(P_{A,C}\\) cell of the adjacency matrix \\(P\\) (highlighted in green) is 2 and the value for the \\(P_{C,A}\\) cell is also 2 (also highlighted in green). Using the language of “groups” to refer to the \\(M\\) nodes, we can say that A and C are share membership in 2 groups.\nNote, the off-diagonal cells represent counts of shared nodes in \\(M\\), not counts of edges. That is what the diagonal represents.\n\n\n\n“Group” Matrix\nTo create the “group” matrix, \\(G\\), which connects nodes in the set \\(M\\), we perform the following matrix multiplication for our adjacency matrix \\(A\\):\n\\[A^T \\times A = G\\] After multiplication we get:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe product matrix has order \\(M \\times M\\) and shows us how groups are connected by people.\nAs with the product matrix \\(P\\), the values of the product matrix \\(G\\) shows two important things:\n\nThe diagonal cells represents the count of ties that a specific node in \\(M\\) has with nodes in \\(N\\)\nThe off-diagonal cells count the number of ways that separate nodes in \\(M\\) are connected by nodes in \\(N\\)\n\nLet’s take a look at each of these points.\n\nDiagonal Cells\nThe diagonal tells us the count of ties that a specific node in \\(M\\) has with nodes in \\(N\\). Using the language of “people” to refer to the \\(N\\) node set, the diagonal is the count of people to which a node in \\(M\\) is connected.\nFor example, in the figure below, 2 is in 3 groups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see this in the graph by counting the edges, but also by looking at the \\(G_{2,2}\\) cell of the adjacency matrix \\(G\\) (highlighted in red).\nHere is a question. What network measure does the diagonal give us? Again, it is degree centrality!\n\n\nOff-Diagonal Cells\nThe off-diagonal cells count the number of ways that separate nodes in \\(M\\) are connected by nodes in \\(N\\). Using the language of “groups” to refer to the \\(M\\) node set, the off-diagonal represents the count of other groups to whom a node in \\(M\\) is connected.\nFor example, in the figure below, nodes 1 and 2 are linked through 2 nodes in \\(M\\), A and C. This means the value for the \\(G_{2,1}\\) cell of the adjacency matrix \\(G\\) (highlighted in green) is 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, note that when we project it forces the matrix to be symmetric. This means that the projection creates an undirected unipartite graph. As a result, the value for the \\(G_{1,2}\\) cell of the adjacency matrix \\(G\\) (also highlighted in green) is 2.\nNote that the off-diagonal cells represent counts of shared nodes in \\(N\\), not counts of edges. That is what the diagonal represents."

    "text": "Dichotomization and Summation\nLet’s return to our “people” matrix, which is a projected \\(N \\times N\\) network. Recall that the adjacency matrix looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we are ready to use the tools we have employed in past chapters, right? Hold up. Note that some the off-diagonal cells are greater than 1. This is new territory for us. Now what?\n\nDichotomization\nThe most common solution is to define any tie greater than 0 in the adjacency matrix as a 1. That is, we would recode values greater than 1 to just be 1. Then, we recode the diagonal elements to be 0. That would then give us an adjacency matrix of 0s and 1s and we could go about our business as crime analysts. This is called dichotomizing the adjacency matrix and is the most common way of handling projections. The consequence is a binary, undirected, unipartite graph. What a mouthful!\nFor the people matrix \\(P\\), we can visualize this process here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, note that we lose some information when we dichotomize the adjacency matrix. Specifically, we are treating connections that are greater than 1 as being the same as connections exactly equal to 1. This may make sense in some circumstances. For example, suppose you are only concerned with whether two individuals have ever been arrested together. In this case, the dichotomized matrix makes sense to examine.\nBut, what if the number of co-arrests is really important? That is, relationships between individuals who have many co-arrests are fundamentally different than those who only have a single co-arrest. In this case, dichotomizing the adjacency matrix could misrepresent the data.\n\n\nSummation\nIn situations where we want to preserve the information in the projection, we can retain the values in the adjacency matrix. When we do so, we are working with a weighted, undirected, unipartite graph. Here, the off-diagonal entries are tie weights. We can use this information in visualizations (such as shown in the case above for the study by Young and Ready (2015)).\nFor example, consider the bipartite network below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we project, we can visualize the differences in the network based on whether we dichotomize the adjacency matrix (on the left) or maintain the weights (on the right).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may be inclined to always keep the network weighted (i.e. not dichotomize the adjacency matrix), but there are far fewer tools for weighted networks. As you continue your work as a crime analyst, be sure to keep in mind what options you have for handling projections."

    "text": "Summary\nThis chapter showed how to project bipartite networks into unipartite graphs. Projection is a useful technique for crime analysts to employ when they need to simplify complex relationships for analysis while retaining critical relational insights. By transforming two-mode data (e.g., individuals and groups) into one-mode networks, analysts can focus on relationships within a single node set, such as connections between co-offenders or shared affiliations between groups. We focused our attention also on the distinction between dichotomized and weighted projections, which allow analysts a way to tailor their approach based on whether binary connections or tie strengths are more relevant to the investigation. The tools and concepts presented, including adjacency matrices, matrix multiplication, and the implications of symmetric matrices, provide foundational methods for analyzing complex relational structures. For crime analysts, mastering these techniques enhances their ability to uncover patterns, predict interactions, and inform data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n\n\nBreiger, Ronald L. 1974. “The Duality of Persons and Groups.” Social Forces 53 (2): 181–90. https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/53.2.181.\n\n\nYoung, Jacob T.
